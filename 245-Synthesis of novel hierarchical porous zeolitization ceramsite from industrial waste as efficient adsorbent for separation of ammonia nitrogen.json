Hence, this study focuses on the zeolite molecular sieves with a large specific surface area and excellent ion exchange performance due to its unique pore structure of zeolite [15-19]. Whether the modified ceramics loaded with zeolite crystals can be obtained through reasonable modifier and modification method? Thus, the composite hierarchical porous ceramsites with ceramsite macropore, mesopore and molecular sieve micropore can be obtained, which is also subversive to the improvement of specific surface area and adsorption capacity of ceramsite.

Although the zeolite powder synthesized by solid waste shows excellent adsorption performance, it is difficult to be used in fixed-bed reactors due to the disadvantages of tiny particles and low mechanical strength. However, there are few reports about synthesis of zeolitization ceramsites from solid waste. Hence, the ceramsites used in fixed-bed reactors from solid waste have been developed, moreover, the regeneration of zeolitization ceramsite method is simple. More interestingly, adsorbed ceramsites without regeneration even can be used for plant cultivation [22]."

This conclusion is consistent with the adsorption kinetics fitting results above. Secondly, the existence of aluminum-oxygen tetrahedron makes zeolite framework have good ion exchange performance [59], which can be confirmed by XPS results.

Combined with the above analysis of adsorption tests, it was further proved that the adsorption mechanism of ammonia nitrogen by modified ceramsite was mainly ion exchange. It shows that the adsorption of ammonia nitrogen by zeolite ceramsite does not completely depend on large specific surface area, which is also the main reason for the good adsorption performance of zeolite ceramsite although the specific surface area has not been significantly improved [50]. Therefore, there are three main mechanisms for the adsorption of ammonia nitrogen ions by the ceramsite. The first is ion exchange, that is, "
