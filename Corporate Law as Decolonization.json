The traditional theory is that former colonies will emerge from the colonial period with the legal mandate and international recognition needed to chart their own futures. But, for those Black and Brown British colonies that achieved political independence, it became clear that, without economic strength to care for their societies, legal separation could not deliver on its promise of freedom from subordination. This Article argues that investments in corporate law innovations by some jurisdictions, such as Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, and the Cayman Islands, have provided a pathway to postcolonial self-determination. These communities have generated immense wealth and autonomy for their populations in the postcolonial era by using strategies akin to those deployed by the State of Delaware. While former colonizers denigrate Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, and the British Virgin Islands as tax havens and corporate law imperialists, which must be aggressively governed to protect the tax base and financial sectors of \"non-tax haven\" countries, there is another side to this narrative: Offshore corporate law is freedom-promoting for some communities. This Article complicates the dominant perspective of corporate law imperialism and introduces a conceptualization of corporate law as decolonization to the legal and policy discourse on offshore financial centers."

I use \"self-determination\" to mean a postcolonial community's enjoyment of a \"domination-free and postimperial [domestic] order\" that prioritizes the social and economic welfare of their members through increased autonomy over governance. Adom Getachew, WORLDMAKING AFTER EMPIRE: THE RISE AND FALL OF SELF-DETERMINATION 74 (2019). In this regard, I use it in a manner similar to that of political scientist Adom Getachew. According to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a community's right to self-determination refers to their ability to \"freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.\" G.A. Res. 2200 (XXI) A, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, art. 1, (Dec. 16, 1966). Importantly, communities have freedom in how they pursue these goals.

These communities are too frequently overlooked and disregarded in international law and policy circles.[49] And, while this Article does not seek to make a claim for reparations for Black and Brown postcolonial OFCs, it suggests that wealthy countries in the Global North consider solutions to the tax evasion and \"financial opacity\"[50] that minimize the harm to vulnerable postcolonial jurisdictions that facilitate offshore business law and offshore finance.[51] In short, this Article complicates the dominant corporate law imperialism perspective and introduces a corporate law as decolonization perspective to the legal and policy discourse on OFCs."

It uses the cases of the UKOTs of Anguilla, Montserrat, and Turks and Caicos Islands as examples of jurisdictions that have pursued offshore financial services but have not gained sufficient success to achieve the economic independence required for meaningful postcolonial self-determination.[55] Part V outlines the implications of decolonization through corporate law.[56] Part 0 concludes the Article by summarizing its central thesis."

The opening lyrics of Marley's song, titled \"Zimbabwe\" as written for the new nation,[80]aignantly stated: \"Every man got a right to decide his own destiny.\"[81] It was this sense of immense possibility for the future, which the people of Zimbabwe would now be responsible for charting for themselves, that imbued the crowd in the stadium with euphoria.[82] While it is difficult to quantify or describe what approximately 40,000 people in Harare were feeling and thinking in that moment, three aspects of independence were likely on their minds: (1) the power to govern freely; (2) the ability to build a more inclusive society; and (3) the right to an international voice.[83]"

They have developed a similar development model to that which has been exemplified in Delaware and marketed by scholars and IFIs.[199] They utilize legal rules and institutions as a means of facilitating commercial activities which have in turn promoted economic growth.[200] Importantly, scholars argue that the attractiveness of MDSJs is not limited to their low or zero corporate tax rates.[201] Indeed, “[a] growing body of evidence concerning jurisdictions generally deemed tax havens suggests that they cannot effectively attract mobile capital on the basis of their tax regimes alone.”[202] Below, I provide examples of three MDSJs—Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, and the Cayman Islands—that have been extraordinarily successful in attracting capital, at least in part, because of their corporate law regimes."

Professor Bruner suggests that \"[s]imilar dynamics would unfold with 'segregated portfolio legislation,' which 'extend[s] the concept of limited liability of a company to certain of its assets'—an innovation of significance to Bermuda's insurance industry.\"[218]"

Of course, some commentators have expressed concern about this seemingly cozy relationship between government regulators and the entities they are tasked with overseeing. See, e.g., Moon, supra note 19, at 1429-32. Arguably, this close and repeated interaction could lead to capture and corruption of the lawmaking process. Id. at 1429-37. The theory is that the jurisdictions' heavy reliance on incorporation fees and the active participation of private sector lawyers in the lawmaking process—not dissimilar from the arrangement in Delaware—obscures whose interest the legislators are serving. But there is little evidence of corruption in these environments. Id. Professor Bruner suggests there are generally \"low levels of perceived public corruption\" in major financial centers such as Bermuda. BRUNER supra note 7, at 47. Indeed, economists Dhammika Dharmapala and James Hines have shown empirically that high levels of corruption are inconsistent with OFC status. Dharmapala & Hines, supra note 202, at 1063-64."

As a process, there is some degree of separation between the former colony (now UKOT) and the former colonial ruler. The UKOT can make policy for itself and, so long as it is economically independent and not reliant on the UK for financial assistance, it is more or less left to its own goals.[335] As an end goal, an economically successful UKOT can provide for a high standard of living for its population and is not beholden to IFIs, as the sovereign developing former colonies in the Caribbean have been in the past.[336] Significantly, in the case of MDSJs of English legal origin, the reputational support of the former colonial ruler strengthens its stature on the world stage—thereby increasing its likelihood of attracting investors and would-be incorporsators.[337]"

Indeed, in response to the then-United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization, a former Caymanian politician, Berna Thompson Murphy, stated: The UN has a responsibility to investigate whether colonies would want to become independent. At one time, this was a useful exercise, as there were some colonies which were oppressed by the mother countries; but there are very few, if any, colonies which still fall into this category. In the case of Cayman[,] we are fully committed to remaining a crown colony .... Even the discussion of independence is out of the question ... if the foreign press headlines say 'UN Commission returns from Cayman following negotiations for independence' you can bet we'll see investors' money leaving Cayman immediately after. We can't allow them any room to suggest that independence can even be discussed."

Anguilla occupies a similar situation regarding its high income. See supra Part IV.A (discussing the economy of Anguilla). But, despite Turks and Caicos' high income, the jurisdiction has an economy based primarily on services, which makes it vulnerable to shifts in the international economy. See LOFT, supra note 8, at 10. Turks and Caicos relies on a handful of industries for its prosperity: \"Wholesale and retail trade (44% of [gross domestic product]), hotels and restaurants (25% [of gross domestic product]), real estate, renting, business activities (10% [of gross domestic product]) (2020).\" Id. Indeed, like Anguilla and Montserrat, Turks and Caicos benefited from EDF support before Britain's exit from the EU. See LOFT, supra note 27, at 18. For example, in 2021 the jurisdiction received €14.6 million for education support from the EU. Id. at 19. The EDF has also been a source of support for Turks and Caicos after major hurricanes in the Caribbean region. See id. at 26. And, as in Anguilla and Montserrat, the Governor (1) has ultimate oversight over the jurisdiction's international financial services operations and (2) has the power to \"make law for good government and order\" for the jurisdiction.

For the MDSJs, if they do their part and maintain a well-functioning, transparent (that is, corruption-free), and effective offshore financial infrastructure, it gives them tremendous standing in the world of international finance[416] and gives the UK less reason to be concerned about their increased dependency.[417]"

To the extent that MDSJs choose to adopt this approach, it could provide them with further economic independence. The offshore model that encourages incorporations without meaningful capital investments could therefore be seen as one step in a \"multi-step development\" model whereby early offshore financial legislation is reformed to facilitate new types of investments—including in the technological space.[434] The legal infrastructure and expertise developed in the offshore finance arena could translate into expertise that could underpin venture capitalists looking to develop technology hubs throughout the Caribbean.[435] Current examples of how meaningful capital investments can transform OFCs that are committed to the sector can be seen in the Cayman Islands and in Bermuda.[436]"

Professor Vanessa Ogle explains: European rule during the 1950s and 1960s was often accompanied by a liquidation and removal of European assets. Distrustful of newly independent governments and non-white rule, fearing resentment, increased taxation or possibly even nationalization, Euro-American businesses active in the colonial world divested from empire. Many Europeans, moreover, held deep-seated racist convictions about the absence of business acumen among native populations and simply could not imagine economic life continuing in regular form after independence. Following decolonization, many low-income countries therefore desperately needed foreign capital to start a process of industrialization and growth promotion .... Decolonization, conceived in economic and financial terms, thus marked a transitory period during which old capital was in part removed, and during and after which new capital had to be mobilized to arrive in the form of official aid and private investment alike.

First, for small jurisdictions like Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, and the British Virgin Islands to ensure inclusive economic development, they must first have wealth to redistribute. Regardless of one's assessment of offshore financial services, the wealth generated from this sector provides a source of income that MDSJs can distribute throughout their societies.[471] Second, there is reason to believe that governments and private sector organizations in MDSJs are making attempts to provide for the overall welfare of their populations and include a cross section of Bermudians in the offshore sector.[472] For example, in the case of Bermuda's dominant insurance and reinsurance sector, the Island's Premier noted that major international law firms and auditing firms are \"employing and training Bermudians\" and that the \"pipeline of local talent\" that supports the sector is growing.[473] Further,"

In the decolonization literature, economic growth, and ultimately economic self-reliance, is considered crucial for meaningful decolonization.[483] In jurisdictions such as Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, and the Cayman Islands, corporate law has been a vehicle for this kind of economic growth and development.[484] As UKOTs, these jurisdictions benefit from their ties to the UK, such as the reputational advantage of being seen by investors as extensions of the UK.[485] Their economic success has led to a heightened standard of living for each of these jurisdictions, and has provided them with greater practical autonomy and authority over their daily governance with respect to the UK.[486]"

Instead, it focuses the attention of scholars and policymakers in the developed world on the fact that colonialism and its progeny, neocolonialism, have forced postcolonial nations to find creative ways to survive and gain some of the freedoms decolonization promised in a competitive and hierarchical global economy.[487] One of these ways is through corporate law.[488] According to Caribbean legal scholar Rose-Marie Belle Antoine, “[o]n the one hand, the development of [OFCs] in the Caribbean is a remarkable example of Caribbean talent, dedication, creativity and brilliance. On the other, the OFC phenomenon is a tragic reminder of a region [hindered] by a world view that has defined our political and economic policy.”[489]"
