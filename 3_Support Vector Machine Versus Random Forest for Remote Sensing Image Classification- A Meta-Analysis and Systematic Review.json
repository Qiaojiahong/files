Among these machine learning algorithms, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) have drawn attention to image classification in several remote sensing applications. This article reviews RF and SVM concepts relevant to remote sensing image classification and applies a meta-analysis of 251 peer-reviewed journal papers. A database with more than 40 quantitative and qualitative fields was constructed from these reviewed papers. The meta-analysis mainly focuses on 1) the analysis regarding the general characteristics of the studies, such as geographical distribution, frequency of the papers considering time, journals, application domains, and remote sensing software packages used in the case studies, and 2) a comparative analysis regarding the performances of RF and SVM classification against various parameters, such as data type, RS applications, spatial resolution, and the number of extracted features in the feature engineering step. The challenges, recommendations, and potential directions for future research are also discussed in detail. Moreover, a summary of the results is provided to aid researchers to customize their efforts in order to achieve the most accurate results based on their thematic applications."

In addition, the availability of high-quality data, the temporal frequency, and comprehensive coverage make them advantageous for several agro-environmental applications compared to the traditional data collections approaches [6]–[8]. In particular, land use and land cover (LULC) mapping is the most common application of RS data for a variety of environmental studies, given the increased availability of RS image archives [9]–[12]. The growing applications of LULC mapping alongside the need for updating the existing maps have offered new opportunities to effectively develop innovative RS image classification techniques in various land management domains to address local, regional, and global challenges [13]–[20]."

Deep learning methods have the ability to retrieve complex patterns and informative features from the satellite imagery. For example, CNN has shown performance improvements over SVM and RF [62], [63]. However, one of the main problems with deep learning approaches is their hidden layers; \"black box\" nature [60], which results in the loss of interpretability (see Fig. 1). Another limitation of deep learning models is that they are highly dependent on the availability of abundant high-quality ground truth data. Moreover, implementing CNN requires expert knowledge and it is computationally expensive and needs dedicated hardware to handle the process. On the other hand, recent research works show SVM and RF (i.e., relatively easily implementable methods) can handle learning tasks with a small amount of training dataset, yet demonstrate competitive results with CNNs [64]. Although there is an ongoing shift in the application of deep learning in RS image classification, SVM and RF have still held the researchers' attention due to lower computational complexity and higher interpretability capabilities compared to deep learning models. More specifically, SVM maintenance among the top classifiers is mainly because of its ability to tackle the problems of high dimensionality and limited training samples [65], while RF holds its position due to ease of use (i.e., does not need much hyperparameter finetuning) and its ability to learn both simple and complex classification functions [66], [67]. As a result, the relatively high similar performance of SVM and RF in terms of classification accuracies makes them among the most popular machine learning classifiers within the RS community [68]. As a result, giving merit to one of them is a difficult task as past comparison-based studies, as well as some review papers, provide readers with often contradictory conclusions, which was somehow confusing. For instance, Mountrakis et al. in [66] reported SVMs can be considered the \"best of class\" algorithms for classification; however, the work in [67] and [69] suggested that RF classifiers may outperform support vector machines for RS image classification. This knowledge gap was identified in the field of bioinformatics and filled by an exclusive review of RFs versus SVMs [70]; however, no such a detailed survey is available for RS image classification."

In SVMs, the main goal is to solve a convex quadratic optimization problem for obtaining a globally optimal solution in theory and thus, overcoming the local extremum dilemma of other machine learning techniques. SVM belongs to nonparametric supervised techniques, which are insensitive to the distribution of underlying data. This is one of the advantages of SVMs compared to other statistical techniques, such as ML, wherein data distribution should be known in advance [68]."

                                    "content": "SVM, in its basic form, is a linear binary classifier, which identifies a single boundary between two classes. The linear SVM assumes the multidimensional data are linearly separable in the input space (see Fig. 3). In particular, SVMs determine an optimal hyperplane (a line in the simplest case) to separate the dataset into a discrete number of predefined classes using the training data. To maximize the separation or margin, SVMs use a portion of the training sample that lies closest in the feature space to the optimal decision boundary, acting as support vectors [72]–[75]. These samples are the most challenging data to classify and have a direct impact on the optimum location of the decision boundary [38], [75]. The optimal hyperplane, or the maximal margin, can be mathematically and geometrically defined. It refers to a decision boundary that minimizes misclassification errors attained during the training step [65], [66]. As seen in Fig. 3, a number of hyperplanes with no sample between them are selected, and then the optimal hyperplane is determined when the margin of separation is maximized [75], [76]. This iterative process of constructing a classifier with an optimal decision boundary is described as the learning process [77]."

To deal with nonlinearly separable data, additional variables (i.e., slack variables) can be added to SVM optimization in the soft margin approach. However, the idea behind the kernel trick is to map the feature space into a higher dimension (Euclidean or Hilbert space) to improve the separability between classes [78], [79].

This space can theoretically be of an infinite dimension where the linear discrimination is possible. There are several kernel models to build different SVMs, satisfying the Mercer's condition, including Sigmoid, Radial basis function, Polynomial, and Linear [80]. Commonly used kernels for remotely sensed image analysis are polynomial and the radial basis function (RBF) kernels [66]. Generally, kernels are selected by predefining a kernel's model (Gaussian, polynomial, etc.) and then adjusting the kernel parameters by tuning techniques, which could be computationally very costly. The classifier's performance, on a portion of the training sample or validation set, is the most important criteria for selecting a kernel function. However, kernel-based models can be quite sensitive to overfitting, which is possibly the main limitation of kernel-based methods, such as SVM [57]. Accordingly, innovative approaches, including automatic kernel selection [75], [79], [81], and multiple kernel learning [82], were proposed to address this problem. Notably, the task of determining the optimum kernel falls into the category of the optimization problem [83]–[87]. Optimizing several SVM parameters is very resource-intensive. So there comes a need for an alternate way of searching out the SVM parameters; genetic optimization algorithm (GA) [88]–[90] and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm [91]. GA-SVM and SVM-PSO are both evolutionary techniques that exploit principles inspired from biological systems to optimize C and gamma. Compared with GA and other similar evolutionary techniques, PSO has some attractive characteristics and, in many cases, proved to be more effective [91]."

This requires a multiclass task to be broken down into a series of simple SVM binary classifiers, following either the one-against-one or one-against-all strategies [92]. However, the binary SVM can be extended to a one-shot multiclass classification, requiring a single optimization process. For example, a complete set of five-class classifications only requires to be optimized once for determining the kernel's parameters C (a parameter that controls the amount of penalty during the SVM optimization) and "

Furthermore, the one-shot multiclass classification uses fewer support vectors while, unlike the conventional one-against-all strategy, it guarantees to produce a complete confusion matrix [93]. SVM classifies high-dimensional big data into a limited number of support vectors, thus achieving the distinction between subgroups within a short period of time. However, the classification of big data is always computationally expensive. As such, hybrid methodologies of the SVM, e.g., Granular Support Vector Machine (GSVM), are introduced in different applications. GSVM is a novel machine learning model based on granular computing and statistical learning theory that addresses the inherently low-efficiency learning problem of the traditional SVM while obtaining satisfactory generalization performance [94]."

SVM is an efficient classifier in high-dimensional spaces, which is particularly applicable to RS image analysis field where the dimensionality can be extremely large [99], [100]. In addition, the decision process of assigning new members only needs a subset of training data. As such, SVM is one of the most memory-efficient methods, since only this subset of training data needs to be stored in memory [100]. The ability to apply new kernels rather than linear boundaries also increases the flexibility of SVMs for the decision boundaries, leading to a greater classification performance. Despite these benefits, there are also some challenges, including the choice of a suitable kernel, optimum kernel parameters selection, and the relatively complex mathematics behind the SVM, especially from a nonexpert user point of"

Ensemble learning is a machine learning scheme to boost accuracy by integrating multiple models to solve the same problem. In particular, multiple classifiers participate in ensemble classification to obtain more accurate results compared to a single classifier. In other words, the integration of multiple classifiers decreases variance, especially in the case of unstable classifiers, and may produce more reliable results. Next, a voting scenario is designed to assign a label to unlabeled samples [11], [103]–[105]. The commonly used voting approach is majority voting, which assigns the label with the maximum number of votes from various classifiers to each unlabeled sample [106]. The popularity of the majority voting method is due to its simplicity and effectiveness. More advanced voting approaches, such as the veto voting method, wherein one single classifier vetoes the choice of other classifiers, can be considered as an alternative for the majority voting method [107]."

Therefore, the final prediction voting mitigates the overfitting in case of the classification problem, while the averaging is the solution for the regression problems. Within the generation of these individual decision trees, each time the best split in the random sample of predictors is chosen as the split candidates from the full set of predictors. A fresh sample of predictors is taken at each split utilizing a user-specified number of predictors (Mtry). By expanding the RF up to a user-specified number of trees (Ntree), RF generates high variance and low bias trees. Therefore, new sets of input (unlabeled) data are assessed against all decision trees that are generated in the ensemble, and each tree votes for a class's membership. The membership with the majority votes will be the one that is eventually selected (see Fig. 6) [113], [114]. This process, hence, should obtain a global optimum [115]. To reach a global optimum, two-thirds of the samples, on average, are used to train the bagged trees, and the remaining samples, namely the out-of-bag (OOB) are employed to cross validate the quality of the RF model independently. The OOB error is used to calculate the prediction error and then to evaluate variable importance measures (VIMs) [116], [117]."

The two major variable importance metrics are: mean decrease in Gini (MDG) and mean decrease in accuracy (MDA) [123]–[125]. MDG measures the mean decrease in node impurities as a result of splitting and computes the best split selection. MDG switches one of the random input variables while keeping the rest constant. It then measures the decrease in the accuracy, which has taken place by means of the OOB error estimation and Gini Index decrease. In a case where all predictors are continuous and mutually uncorrelated, Gini VIM is not supposed to be biased [26]. MDA, however, takes into account the difference between two different OOB errors, the one that resulted from a dataset obtained by randomly permuting the predictor variable of interest and the one resulted from the original dataset [102]."

RFs are reported to be less sensitive to the Ntree compared to Mtry [126]. Reducing Mtry parameter may result in faster computation, but reduces both the correlation between any two trees and the strength of every single tree in the forest and thus, has a complex influence on the classification accuracy [113]. Since the RF classifier is computationally efficient and does not overfit, Ntree can be as large as possible [127]. Several studies found 500 as an optimum number for the Ntree because the accuracy was not improved by using Ntrees higher than this number [115]. Another reason for this value being commonly used could be the fact that 500 is the default value in the software packages like R package; \"randomForest\" [128]."

The Mtry parameter is recommended to be set to the square root of the number of input features in classification tasks and one-third of the number of input features for regression tasks [102]. Although methods based on bagging, such as RF, unlike other methods based on boosting, are not sensitive to noise or overtraining [129], [130], the above-stated value for Mtry might be too small in the presence of a large number of noisy predictors, i.e., in the case of noninformative predictor variables, the small Mtry results in building inaccurate trees [26]."

They have been widely adopted and applied as a standard classifier to a variety of prediction and classification tasks, such as those in bioinformatics [131], computer vision [132], and RS land cover classification [133]. RF has gained its popularity in land cover classification due to its clear and understandable decision-making process and excellent classification results [115], as well as easy implementation of RF in a parallel structure for geo-big data computing acceleration [134].

Notably, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) were followed for study selection [138]. After numerous trials, three groups of keywords were considered to retrieve relevant literature in a combination on and up to October 28, 2019 (see Fig. 7). The keywords in the first and last columns were searched in the topic (title/abstract/keyword) to include papers that used data from the most common RS platforms and addressed a classification problem. However, the keywords in the second column were exclusively searched in the title to narrow the search down. This resulted in obtaining studies that only employed SVM and RF algorithms in their analysis."

Apart from a brief drop between 2010 and 2011, there was a moderate increase in case studies using SVM from 2002 to 2014. However, this slips back for four subsequent years, followed by significant growth in 2019. Studies using RFs, on the other hand, shows the steady increase in the given time-span, which resulted in an exponential distribution in the equivalent cumulative distribution function. The number of studies employed SVMs were always more than those that used RFs until 2016, wherein the number crossed over in favor of utilizing RFs. The sharp decrease in using both RF and SVM between 2014 and 2019 can be clearly explained by the advent of utilizing deep learning models in the RS community [140].

R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics and widely used for data analysis and development of statistical software. Most of the implementations in R were carried out using the caret package [141], which provides a standard syntax to execute a variety of machine learning methods, and e1071 package [142], which is the first implementation of SVM method in R. The dominance of statistical and data analysis software especially R, Python (scikit-learn package), and MATLAB is mainly because of the flexibility of these interfaces in dealing with extensive machine learning frameworks such as image preprocessing, feature selection and extraction, resampling methods, parameter tuning, training data balancing, and classification accuracy comparisons. In terms of the commercial software, for RF, eCognition is the most popular one, with about "

However, when it comes to SAR, LIDAR, and fusion of different sensors, RF is the focal point. The mean classification accuracy of SVM remains higher than the RF method in all sensor types except in SAR image data. Although it does not mean that in those cases, the SVM method works better than RF, it gives a hint about the range of accuracies that might be reached when using the SVM or RF. Moreover, it can be observed that, except for hyperspectral data in case of using the RF method, the mean classification accuracies are generally more than "

For LULC studies, the papers mostly adopted the publicly available benchmark datasets, as the main focus was on hyperspectral image classification. The most used datasets were from AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) and ROSIS (Reflective Optics System Imaging Spectrometer) hyperspectral sensors. For crop classification, the mainly used data was AVIRIS, followed by MODIS imageries. While in urban studies, Worldview-2 and IKONOS satellite imageries were the most frequently employed data. On the other hand, other studies mainly focused on the nonpublic image dataset for the region under study based on the application. Therefore, there is a satisfying number of studies that have focused on the real-world RS applications of both SVM and RF classifiers."

Therefore, in the case of using high spatial resolution RS imagery, RF remains the most employed method, while in the case of medium- and low-resolution images, SVMs are the most commonly used method. A relatively robust trend is observed for the SVM method as the image data pixel size increases the average accuracy decreases. Such a trend can be observed for RF regarding that OA versus resolution is inconsistent among the three categories. Hence, in the case of the RF classifier, it is not possible to get a direct relationship between the classification accuracy and the resolution. However, in the high and medium resolution scenarios, the SVM method shows the higher average OAs."

After a better understanding of the trends, strengths, and limitations of RFs and SVMs in the current study, the possibility of integrating two or more algorithms to solve a problem should be more investigated where the goal should be to utilize the strengths of one method to complement the weaknesses of another. If we are only interested in the best possible classification accuracy, it might be difficult or impossible to find a single classifier that performs as well as an excellent ensemble of classifiers. Mechanisms that are used to build the ensemble of classifiers, including using different subsets of training data with a single learning method, using different training parameters with a single training method, and using different learning methods, should be further investigated. In this sense, researchers may consider multiple variation of nearest neighbor techniques (e.g., K-NN) along with RF and SVM for both prediction and mapping."

These advantages make SVM and RF well-suited for multisensor data fusion to further improve the classification performance of a single sensor data source [147], [148]. Due to the recent and sharp increase in the availability of data captured by various sensors, future studies will investigate SVM and RF more for these essential applications."

The most widely used ones are scikit-learn [149] for Python, Weka [150] for Java, and mlj [151] for Julia. The most important toolboxes for R are mlr, caret [141], and tidy models [152]. Most recently, the mlr3 [153] package has become available for complex multistage experiments with advanced functionality that use a broad range of machine learning functionality. The authors of this study also suggest that researchers explore the diverse functionality of this package in their studies. We also would like to invite researchers to report their variable importance, class imbalance, class homogeneity, and sampling strategy and design in their studies. More importantly, to avoid spatial autocorrelation, if possible, samples for training should be selected randomly and spatially uncorrelated; purposeful samples should be avoided. For benchmark datasets, this study recommends researchers to use the standard sets of training and test samples already separated by the corresponding data provider. In this way, the classification performance of different approaches becomes comparable. To increase the fairness of the evaluation, RS societies have been developing evaluation leaderboards where researchers"

The choice of the most appropriate image classification algorithm is one of the hot topics in many research fields that deploy images of a vast range of spatial and spectral resolutions taken by different platforms while including many limitations and priorities. RF and SVM, as well-known and top-ranked machine learning algorithms, have gained the researchers' and analysts' attention in the field of data science and machine learning. Since there is ongoing employment of these methods in different disciplines, the common question is which method is highlighted based on the task properties. This article focused on a meta-analysis of comparison of peer-reviewed studies on RF and SVM classifiers. Our research aimed to statistically quantify the characteristics of these methods in terms of frequency and accuracy. The meta-analysis was conducted to serve as a descriptive and quantitative method of comparison using a database containing 251 eligible papers in which "
