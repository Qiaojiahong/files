By that time, most of the leading law schools had established journals as a perfect complement to the casebook method of teaching, as an avenue for the faculty to publish their views, and, not least, as a service to the bar. The major barrier to forming the new journal was finding a sustaining source of funds. The ongoing cost was why many law-school administrations refused to commit the resources to finance a law journal."

I am grateful to Scott Atlas, Michael Churgin, Meele Dickerson, John Golden, and Ward Farnsworth for their valuable comments on a prior draft. I give special thanks to John Burritt McArthur, my predecessor as Editor in Chief on the Review, for his skillful edit and extensive comments. I also am indebted to Molly Brownfield, the Deputy Law Library Director, Tarlton Law Library, and Jonathan Molinar, a 2021 graduate of The University of Texas School of Law, for their help in designing and compiling the research for this essay. On behalf of the law school community, I acknowledge the extraordinary work of Scott Atlas in singlehandedly organizing the 100th Anniversary Texas Law Review Celebration and thank him for his decades of support to the law school."

As dean at Northwestern, Leon Green lamented the fact that law schools \"have never considered themselves nor have they been considered by the bar in America as a part of the legal profession.\"[22] The Texas Law Review, however, has managed to attract the support of its former editors and members, who have given their time, resources, and leadership to support the Review's mission of the institution. A review of the officers of the corporation, now the Texas Law Review Association, reveals distinguished judges, prominent lawyers, and leading academics who have remained involved throughout the last century."

Since it generally takes decades to accumulate enough citations to make an all-time most-cited ranking, it is almost impossible for a very recent article to make the cut. Very old articles may also be disfavored, since the size of the citing literature was smaller and footnoting was less extensive in the early and mid-twentieth century. There is also subject bias. There are more opportunities to be cited in fields, such as constitutional law, procedure, contracts, property, torts, and criminal law, that have more extensive literatures. Fields like corporate law, family law, intellectual property, and international law have smaller literatures and thus fewer opportunities to be cited.[25]"

Easterbrook wrote a forty-page article that set forth the thesis that judicial decisions that prevent competitive behavior are more harmful to society than those that allow anticompetitive behavior.30 Easterbrook postulated that errors in deciding monopolization cases impose costs upon markets and illustrate the \"limits\" of antitrust law.31 He proposed a solution that erred on the side of permitting questionable practices because, he argued, the costs of prohibiting competitive behavior were significant.32 Scholars have cited this article because the courts adopted much of Easterbook's analysis, even as the topic of monopolization in antitrust laws continues to be litigated and debated in new industries.33 Judge Easterbrook is one of the most influential antitrust"

Orgain lecture Justice Rehnquist delivered at Texas Law.[36] However, constitutional law scholars have viewed Rehnquist's \"observations\" as one of his \"first major 'off the bench' articulations of his constitutional and judicial philosophy ... [that] influenced the growing conservative legal movement and future Reagan administration.\"[37] This piece clearly articulated the philosophy of judicial restraint: Justice Rehnquist argues that activism by an appointed judiciary is an \"end run around\" an elected government.[38] It is not surprising to see a high number of citations to a Supreme Court Justice who articulated a judicial philosophy that became part of a political movement."

Common to these articles is the prominence of the authors as leaders in their field—scholars who today appear on lists of highly cited scholars at their respective institutions and who hold positions at top law schools—and topics that are viewed as forging substantial new ground in their area and therefore are frequently addressed in subsequent scholarship."

They represent a balance of the constitutional law/theory and intellectual property/corporate/antitrust fields in which Texas Law has professors with national reputations. Four articles in the top ten were authored or co-authored by Texas Law professors, and one sees the influence of our faculty throughout most cited articles in the various decades. I suspect few are surprised by the articles and authors represented on this top ten list, but some, including, of course, past Board editors and Review members, will believe that other articles deserved to make the list too."

Although Dean Green pitched the law review as serving the lawyers of Texas,[52] the faculty members who actively supported the law review were involved in national dialogues on the development of the law and how to best improve legal education.[53] Thus, from the beginning, the Texas Law Review sought to address the dual goals of serving the state's lawyers and also advancing larger national debates over the law.[54] One might wonder how the Texas Law Review could satisfy the members of the Texas Bar and their local interests, yet continue to develop a national reputation at the same time. It succeeded at both because the core faculty in torts, oil and gas, trial procedure and evidence, and constitutional law were productive and prominent scholars on a national level and because Texas law sufficiently often served as a model for consideration of similar issues in other states."

Texas courts and law school professors were on the forefront of this developing area. Oil-and-gas scholarship appeared prominently on the most cited lists in the first four decades.

Professors such as A.W. Walker saw the chance to influence judicial decisions on unresolved oil-and-gas problems and made the most of the opportunity. Leon Green, Page Keeton, and Charles McCormick helped transform the law in their respective fields. They substantially influenced how scholars and judges thought about such issues. Not only were these articles of interest to practitioners, but they were also powerful pieces of academic scholarship. In other words, one might view them as doctrinal scholarship with policy and theoretical underpinnings. These articles furthered theory and practice in a substantial way."

Most of these articles focused on public law.

The Law School added a number of faculty in constitutional and public law. The Texas Law Review, in turn, often relied upon these professors to host symposia. In the last fifty years of"

The Texas faculty's clout contributed significantly to a rapid increase in the Review's national reputation. As expertise in the faculty evolved and expanded to other areas of the law, so did the Review."

They also do not usually have a chance to present their work at conferences and workshops. Exceptions do occur when law students have advanced degrees or reputations in another discipline and student editors may later become law professors and continue writing in the area, develop good reputations, and find even their notes cited as a result. Student notes and comments are also usually written on narrower topics and shorter than most law-review articles.

In Appendix B, I have organized the most cited student works by decade. Before 1977, student works were either classified as comments or short notes, and they often focused on a case or narrow topic. Starting in the 1978 Volume 56, the Texas Law Review began to publish the modern note: a student publication that typically identifies a problem, presents the various arguments and policies on every side, and proposes a resolution. I have divided the 1970s decade to reflect these two types of student works. It is interesting to review the topics that attract the most citations."

The TLRA through its life member program and fundraising has provided scholarships to editors, emergency low-interest loans to members, and funding for hosting the annual symposia. And the Review produces a core of loyal graduates who serve on the law school foundation and alumni associations. The relationship between the institution of the Texas Law Review and its alumni is one important key to its success."

But the editorial boards have astutely relied upon faculty connections to scholars in specific fields and thereby attracted high-quality publications. This relationship began with Leon Green, Ira Hildebrand, and Charles Potts, but a review of the top cited scholarship highlights the importance of faculty contributions to the Review. Of course, one finds countless additional faculty-written articles just below the top ten in each decade that have profoundly contributed to the Review's offerings."
