An ileostomy is a stoma formed from the ileum. If the stoma is formed higher up in the GI tract, from the jejunum, this is called a jejunostomy. Stomas formed lower down the GI tract, from the colon, are colostomies. Stomas of the GI tract are created when part of the intestine must be removed and/or rested to promote healing because of disease, surgery, or injury. Common conditions requiring ileostomy formation are Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and colorectal cancer."

This review highlights gaps in the literature that need addressing to inform ileostomy management in clinical practice, and identifies dietary strategies and outcomes requiring investigation in future studies."

This included modification of the usual foods and drinks a person consumes, to manage complications and nutritional consequences associated with the ileostomy. Examples identified in the protocol for this review were fiber modification; low-residue diets; reintroduction diets; added salt; low-fat diet; probiotics and/or prebiotics; increased low-fiber starchy carbohydrates; regular intake of gelatin-containing sweets; specific food/drink avoidance such as onions, nuts, and fizzy drinks; high-energy and/or protein diet; and oral nutritional supplement drinks.[26] Only evidence relating to oral diet was included. Artificial nutrition support (enteral and parenteral nutrition) is a separate concept and was therefore excluded."

Furthermore, although oral rehydration solutions and fluid-management protocols were initially given as examples for inclusion within the review, subsequent studies that focused on these aspects were excluded. Strict fluid management including use of oral rehydration solutions in combination with medication, such as loperamide or codeine, is key to management of short bowel syndrome and intestinal failure. Similar medical management is also common for high-output stoma; however, there is a clear distinction between this and general fluid advice for stoma management, such as limiting caffeinated, fizzy, and alcoholic drinks (which were included in the review)."

Following JBI guidance, a three-step search strategy was performed.[30] In step 1, an initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL was carried out, followed by analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe the article. Identified keywords and index terms were included in the full search strategy. In step 2, the full search strategy was performed in each of the specified databases. Appendix I contains the full search strategy for MEDLINE. This search strategy was tailored to each database. Searches were carried out first in 2018 and updated in August 2019 (Appendix I). In step 3, reference lists of all included articles were screened to identify additional relevant articles. The final list of included articles was checked for completeness by subject experts. No date limitation was included in the search strategy;"

Articles failing to meet the criteria for inclusion were excluded, and full texts for all the remaining articles were retrieved. Full texts were then assessed in detail against the inclusion/exclusion criteria by two independent reviewers (AM and CA, or AM and CE). Full-text articles that did not meet the criteria for inclusion were excluded, and these are detailed in Appendix II. Any disagreements between reviewers were resolved through discussion, and where necessary, a third reviewer was involved (CA or CE). Where a decision to include or exclude was unclear due to ambiguity in the study, authors were contacted for clarification."

A low FODMAP diet was also shown to thicken output consistency in one study.[49] One observational study reported increased output volume with a high-fat diet,[69] and a pre-post study also suggested high fat to be associated with loose, watery output. Alcohol was suggested to increase output in two pre-post studies,[6,60] and was associated with increased loose, watery output in one observational study.[70]"

A large range of oral dietary strategies have been reported, which could be grouped into three types of dietary strategy: i) nutrient modifications, ii) foods and drinks, and iii) eating-related behaviors. The research evidence for most dietary strategies came primarily from observational studies, nearly all of which were cross-sectional and relied on participant self-report. Ten outcomes relating to ileostomy management were identified in relation to these dietary strategies: volume and consistency of stoma output, dehydration, flatulence, odor, blockage, pain, malnutrition, food visible in output, and leakage."

This limitation in sample size meant that the majority of studies were underpowered and had poor generalizability of findings. Pre-post studies included a combination of dietary strategies in the intervention. The benefit of this is that it represents real-world practice; however, it is impossible to determine which components of the intervention contributed to its effectiveness. In observational studies, the reliance on self-report of diet and ileostomy-related outcomes is a common weakness. Integral to this, specifically in the context of the aims of this review, is the inability to determine from the findings whether reported associations between specific dietary strategies/components and a particular outcome were based on practical experience of the participant or advice they received and followed. Inclusion of qualitative studies helped ensure the full range of potential dietary strategies for ileostomy management was mapped. However, due to the nature of the included qualitative studies, little insight can be gained into the effectiveness of any dietary strategy reported, or how widely it is used."

The most common nutrient modifications across research studies and expert opinion were fiber, fat, and alcohol. Across most outcomes and articles, low fiber and low fat were suggested to be beneficial, while alcohol was detrimental. Other nutrient associations frequently reported in expert opinion (but with minimal attention in research studies) included negative consequences of caffeinated drinks and positive consequences of white starchy carbohydrates on stoma output. Eating-related behaviors were infrequently reported in research studies and, when they were, this was usually as part of a multi-component intervention in pre-post studies, or occasionally in observational studies, and usually not associated with a specific outcome. As expected, the issues commonly addressed were the same as those that caused difficulty for large numbers of people with an ileostomy in a recent survey, namely very loose or watery stoma output, wind or gas, high volume of stoma output, and increased odor from stoma bag.[22] Volume and"

As the majority of GI residue is produced by foods containing fiber, and fiber content can be measured, it would seem prudent for future clinical research and practice to follow the recommendations made by Vanauwaert et al.111 in their review of low-residue and low-fiber diets, to redefine the low-residue diet as a low-fiber diet. In our review, and that of Vanauwaert et al.,111 there was considerable variation between studies in the quantitative definition of a low-fiber diet or meal. Therefore, clinicians need to be aware of how low fiber was defined in different studies when using research to inform advice on a low-fiber diet for patients, including those with an ileostomy.

The evidence included in our review consistently suggested that insoluble fiber is associated with negative outcomes, such as blockage and high or loose output in people with an ileostomy. The role of soluble fiber in ileostomy management is unclear, although some sources have reported it to be beneficial.[81,94,112,113] Thus, if the relative contributions of soluble and insoluble fiber to total intake are not reported in studies investigating high-fiber versus low-fiber diets in people with an ileostomy, it will not be possible to conclude whether findings are due to total fiber intake or the amount of insoluble or soluble fiber consumed."

Lists of foods and drinks that could cause a specific negative outcome (eg, high output) were often reported without guidance on whether people with an ileostomy should limit, avoid completely, or cautiously consume and only avoid these foods and drinks if problematic. Other articles did acknowledge individual differences in tolerating certain foods and drinks, suggesting a gradual trial and error approach following ileostomy surgery. This approach is supported by findings from observational studies where many individual foods and drinks were reported by some people to be problematic; however, most people with an ileostomy could tolerate the same foods and drinks well. In some studies, a small number of foods were reported as problematic by a high proportion of people with an ileostomy, but most were problematic for less than "

Stoma nurses are specialists in stoma management, including ileostomies, while dietitians are specialists in clinical nutrition and providing individualized dietary advice. A recent study showed that people with an ileostomy want more dietary advice from a dietitian, in addition to advice from their stoma nurse.[22] It is therefore important for stoma nurses and dietitians to work together to provide the most relevant and consistent dietary advice. Multidisciplinary collaboration with other HCPs who provide care to people with an ileostomy (ie, colorectal surgeons and inflammatory bowel disease/colorectal specialist nurses) is likely to further improve patient experience and outcomes."

Presenting this information from clinical practice alongside a synthesis of the research evidence shows the extent to which research findings inform and are reflected in the dietary advice provided to people with an ileostomy. Understanding current perspectives and behaviors in clinical practice also helps to inform priorities for future research. Another strength of this review was that a multidisciplinary team of reviewers was involved at all stages of the review process providing diversity of clinical and methodological perspectives."

Due to the sheer number of individual foods and drinks reported across studies, only those reported in more than one study were presented within the main tables. This may suggest that these foods/drinks were definitively associated with outcomes, but as discussed previously, the evidence was not clear cut for most foods. Another limitation that this review did not include acute fluid management or dietary management in people with short bowel syndrome. There is a large body of literature in this area that lends itself to a separate review because these findings and recommendations are not appropriate for inclusion within general dietary advice for people with an ileostomy."

As demonstrated by the variation in advice between expert opinion articles published in the previous decade, the lack of a robust evidence base to inform advice may lead to it being inadequate, inconsistent, and often conflicting. Dietary advice may also be overly restrictive without strong supporting evidence. These findings go some way to explaining why people with an ileostomy are often dissatisfied with the dietary advice they receive. This combination of insufficient research evidence, along with multidisciplinary provision of dietary advice for people with an ileostomy, supports a need for local multidisciplinary team consensus with collaborative development of literature/advice on dietary management to improve clarity and consistency of advice. To increase understanding and trust, it is important for HCPs to acknowledge the uncertainty in dietary advice for ileostomy management and the potential for individual differences."

For example, we need to better understand whether dietary strategies to prevent adverse outcomes for ileostomy management are effective in the short- and long-term following ileostomy surgery, and whether the same or different dietary strategies are effective in managing/resolving common issues when they arise. A potential intervention study may provide standardized dietary information immediately following ileostomy formation, with follow-up sessions during the six months post-surgery to monitor intake and GI symptoms, and provide tailored dietary advice based on the individual patient experience."
