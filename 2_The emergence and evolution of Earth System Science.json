Here, we discuss the emergence and evolution of ESS, outlining the importance of these developments in advancing our understanding of global change. Inspired by early work on biosphere-geosphere interactions and by novel perspectives such as the Gaia hypothesis, ESS emerged in the 1980s following demands for a new 'science of the Earth'. The International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme soon followed, leading to an unprecedented level of international commitment and disciplinary integration. ESS has produced new concepts and frameworks central to the global-change discourse, including the Anthropocene, tipping elements and planetary boundaries. Moving forward, the grand challenge for ESS is to achieve a deep integration of biophysical processes and human dynamics to build a truly unified understanding of the Earth System."

Although other definitions of ESS include the whole planetary interior[4,5], the processes of which become increasingly important as the timescale of consideration increases[6], we focus on the surface, where the majority of materials are cycled within the Earth System."

Examples include J. Hutton's 1788 'theory of the Earth', Humboldtian science in the 19th century and V. Vernadsky's 1926 'The Biosphere'. Understanding the historical roots of ESS, however, requires a focus on the second half of the 20th century when, in a Cold War context, important shifts occurred in the Earth and environmental sciences. Thanks to military patronage taking precedence over traditional sources of funding for Earth sciences, geophysics experienced unprecedented growth. Moreover, surveying and monitoring the global environment became a strategic imperative, providing information that would later be useful for contemporary ESS[10,11]."

This unprecedented research campaign coordinated the efforts of 67 countries to obtain a more integrated understanding of the geosphere, particularly glaciology, oceanography and meteorology. One of the key impacts of the IGY was a lasting transformation in the practices used to understand how the Earth works. The interpretative and qualitative geological and climatological research based on field observations - as classically studied by geographers - was replaced by field instrumentation, continuous and quantitative monitoring of multiple variables and numerical models. This transformation led to the two contemporary paradigms that structure the Earth sciences: modern climatology and plate tectonics14,15."

The IGBP was originally structured around a number of core projects on biogeochemical aspects of the Earth System: ocean carbon cycle, terrestrial ecosystems, atmospheric chemistry, the hydrological cycle and others. Two projects of particular importance were Past Global Changes (PAGES) and Global Analysis, Integration, and Modelling (GAIM), given their locus of strong disciplinary integration. In addition, the IGBP developed a dedicated project on data and information systems (DIS), especially remotely sensed data, to support the research."

A classic example is the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), built around a growing fleet of autonomous platforms, such as the Argo floats, that continuously collect and transmit ocean data. On land, global networks of long-term sites, such as FLUXNET, measure the fluxes of energy and gases between the land surface and the atmosphere and rooting depths in the soils of major ecosystems[63]. Such process-level studies complement remote-sensing observations by providing critical insights into the underlying dynamics that generate the patterns of a changing Earth System observed from space."

GCMs are based on the fundamental physics and chemistry of the climate system, including the exchange of energy and materials between the Earth's surface (land, ocean, ice and, increasingly, the biosphere) and the atmosphere[79,80]. They are forced by scenarios of human greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions, providing possible trajectories of the future climate and their impacts that can be assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and used to inform policy and governance. However, there is considerable uncertainty in long-term GCM projections, influenced by parameterizations and omitted or inadequate constraints on feedback processes and interactions between the geosphere and biosphere[81,82]. In addition, GCMs lack human dynamics as an integral, interactive part of the model, instead treating them as an outside force that perturbs the biogeophysical Earth System."

IAMs have a number of uses, for example, simulating costs of specific climate-stabilization policies, exploring climate risks and uncertainties based on a range of potential policies, identifying optimal policies for a specific climate target and providing more general insights into feedbacks within the coupled system[87]. In addition, IAMs provide critical information on future greenhouse gas and aerosol emission scenarios, which are used to force the GCM simulations. However, the economic components of IAMs are rarely interactively coupled with GCMs to build a completely integrated Earth System model. An early exception to this generalization is the MIT Integrated Global System Model (IGSM), which coupled a computable general equilibrium (CGE) economics model to a detailed GCM[88,89]."

The most influential concept is that of the Anthropocene, introduced by P. J. Crutzen to describe the new geological epoch in which humans are the primary determinants of biospheric and climatic change (BOX 2). The Anthropocene has become an exceptionally powerful unifying concept that places climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution and other environmental issues, as well as social issues such as high consumption, growing inequalities and urbanization, within the same framework[108,109]. Importantly, the Anthropocene is building the foundation for a deeper integration of the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities, and contributing to the development of sustainability science through research on the origins of the Anthropocene and its potential future trajectories[110,111]."

They describe important features of the Earth System that are not characterized by linear relationships but can instead show strongly nonlinear, sometimes irreversible, threshold-abrupt change behaviour[74,112-114]. Tipping elements include important biomes such as the Amazon rainforest and boreal forests, major circulation systems such as the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and large ice masses such as the Greenland ice sheet[74]. In the latter example, a reinforcing feedback occurs: as the ice sheet melts, its surface lowers into a warmer climate, increasing the melting rate and, beyond a critical point of self-reinforcement, the feedback loop leads to an irreversible loss of the ice sheet[74]. More recent research has focused on the causal coupling between tipping elements via changes in temperature, precipitation patterns and oceanic and atmospheric circulation and their potential to form cascades[114-116]. Tipping cascades could"

In the 21st century, the concept of the Anthropocene, which arose in ESS, challenges not only the scientific community but humanity itself. ESS now faces two critical research challenges. First, how stable and resilient is the Earth System? Can tipping cascades generate a planetary tipping point? Are there accessible states of the system that would threaten human well-being? Secondly, how can we better understand the dynamics of human societies? What can ESS contribute to understanding — and perhaps to steering — the integrated geosphere-biosphere-anthroposphere trajectory of the Anthropocene?"

A detailed systems diagram of the Earth System, inspired by the original Bretherton diagram (FIG. 2), but with humans (the anthroposphere) as a fully integrative, interacting sphere. The internal dynamics of the anthroposphere are depicted as a production/consumption core driven by energy systems and modulated by human societies, as influenced by their cultures, values, institutions and knowledge. Interactions between the Anthropocene and the rest of the Earth System are two way, with human greenhouse gas emissions, resource extraction and pollutants driving impacts that reverberate through the geosphere-biosphere system. Feedbacks to the anthroposphere are also important, including direct impacts of climate change and biosphere degradation, and also psycho-social feedbacks from the rest of the Earth System and within the anthroposphere.

In the policy arena, the earlier Millennium Development Goals, which were strongly human-centric, have now been replaced by the Sustainable Development Goals, which retain a strong human focus on development, equity and other human issues, but embed them in a broader, Earth-System context. One of the most innovative of all new approaches is the Common Home of Humanity, which proposes formal, legal recognition of a stable and accommodating state of the Earth System itself (i.e. a Holocene-like state, as defined by the planetary boundaries) as the intangible, natural heritage of all humanity"
