Thus, tremendous efforts have been devoted to addressing the critical challenges associated with sustainable ZABs, aiming to significantly improve their energy efficiency and prolong their operation lifespan. The growing interest in sustainable ZABs requires in-depth research on oxygen electrocatalysts, electrolytes, and Zn anodes, which have not been systematically reviewed to date. In this review, the fundamentals of ZABs, oxygen electrocatalysts for air cathodes, physicochemical properties of ZAB electrolytes, and issues and strategies for the stabilization of Zn anodes are systematically summarized from the perspective of fundamental characteristics and design principles. Meanwhile, significant advances in the in situ/operando characterization of ZABs are highlighted to provide insights into the reaction mechanism and dynamic evolution of the electrolyte/electrode interface. Finally, several critical thoughts and perspectives are provided regarding the challenges and opportunities for sustainable ZABs. Therefore, this review provides a thorough understanding of the advanced sustainable ZAB chemistry, hoping that this timely and comprehensive review can shed light on the upcoming research horizons of this prosperous area."

In 1932, Heiser and Schumacher changed the electrolyte from neutral to alkaline media, which improved the discharging performance of ZABs.[15] Meanwhile, the packaging technology of batteries has also been upgraded, allowing alkaline ZABs to serve as a power source for hearing aids, railway signals and other equipment. Furthermore, the working lifespan of primary ZABs can be extended by mechanically replacing the Zn electrode and electrolyte. In 2006, a gel electrolyte was reported for alkaline ZABs.[16] In the past twenty years, the substantial progress in nanotechnology has driven the development of materials and catalytic science, and thus the development of rechargeable ZABs.[17] However, achieving stable electrochemical charging is the biggest challenge for rechargeable ZABs. To date, the full potential of rechargeable ZABs has not been realized. The"

Thus, the rational design of individual components and device systems is essential to achieve a satisfactory performance in sustainable ZABs. Currently, electrocatalytic oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) catalysts for the air cathode have been intensively explored. With a deeper understanding of ZABs, the electrolyte, Zn anode and electrolyte|electrode interface stability also exert a great influence on the reaction mechanism, performance improvement, etc. In addition, maintaining the electrochemical interface stability is the key to ensuring the long-term stable operation of ZABs."

To provide an in-depth understanding of ZABs, our discussion mainly focuses on the design principles of key materials and their structure-property relationship at the atomic level. From the perspective of reaction mechanism, we briefly summarize the significant advances of different types of ZABs. Secondly, the air cathodes are systematically introduced, including atomic-level engineering, oxygen electrocatalysts and the design of air cathodes. Then, the characteristics of ZAB electrolytes and the corresponding design principles are comprehensively reviewed.

These advancements not only lead to a deeper understanding of sustainable ZABs, but also broaden their application scenarios. In addition, the external environment also has a vital influence on the performance of ZABs, which requires careful attention and fine exploration. In this section, we aim to introduce the fundamental concepts of ZABs, and then classify ZABs according to their specific functions. Then, the characteristics and advantages of different types of ZABs will be emphasized. Finally, the integrated design of ZABs with other functional devices is also presented."

In the charging process of ZABs, a large number of bubbles cover the catalytic active sites of the air cathode, leading to the degradation of their cycling performance. As a semi-open system, the electrolyte stability is the key factor determining the charging-discharging ability and service lifespan of ZABs. Compared with the conventional static electrolyte, a flowing electrolyte significantly improves the electrochemical performance of ZABs by minimizing the unfavourable effects.[30-32] The flowing electrolyte reduces the concentration polarization, thus enabling favourable rechargeability and excellent stability even at a high current density. Nonetheless, aqueous ZABs are prone to leakage problems, bringing security risks. In this case, aqueous electrolytes were replaced with quasi-solid-state (QSS) gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs), resulting in flexible and stretchable ZABs, which possess a broad application prospect in wearable devices, robots, etc. The configuration of QSS ZABs includes sandwich type and cable type (Fig. 4b and c, respectively).[33,34] In the case of sandwich-type QSS ZABs, a GPE is sandwiched between the Zn anode and the air cathode. The sandwich-type structure is similar to aqueous ZABs, which is the more popular configuration. Moreover, sandwich-type QSS ZABs can deliver a stable voltage response under different bending or twisting conditions. In the case of cable-type QSS ZABs, they adopt a typical coil design. The Zn anode is located at the center, which is wrapped by GPEs. Then, the catalyst layer-loaded air electrode is winded on the ZABs. Moreover, QSS ZABs exhibit excellent capability to adapt to complex mechanical forces and deformations.[35] The matching of the mechanical strength of different materials should also be considered to ensure long-term stable operation. Considering the complexity of the working conditions, a suitable pressure is employed to maintain good interfacial contact.[36] Additionally, the output performance can be adjusted by series or parallel connection of the battery pack.[37,38]"

Thus, to promote the practical application of ZABs, the development of pouch cells and coin-cells is necessary. 1-Ah-scale zinc-air pouch cells (ZPCs) were established via the simultaneous optimization of the cathodes, electrolytes, and anodes (Fig. 4d).39 The 1-Ah-scale ZPCs exhibited ultrahigh cell-level energy densities, long-cycle life, and wide operating temperature range. Coin-type ZABs have a small size and simple structure, which are convenient for batch assembly.40 The assembly process of coin-type batteries is relatively mature, and their structure is shown in Fig. 4e.

An overpotential is used to overcome the activation energy of the electrochemical reaction, causing activation polarization. At a low temperature, the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte decreases, and the electron transport between the electrodes and interfaces also decreases, resulting in a significant increase in ohmic polarization. At a high potential, the ionic diffusion rate of the electrolyte is slower than the electrochemical reaction rate due to the limitation of mass transfer, causing concentration polarization. Hence, low-temperature ZABs show a low critical current density and limited cycling stability.

Meanwhile, some typical examples are simultaneously highlighted to understand their structure-activity relationship at the atomic level. In addition, the micro/nano-architecture and surface wettability of air cathodes also play a crucial role in the ion transfer for high-rate ZABs. In this section, we mainly review the atomic-level modulation engineering strategies for electrocatalytic ORR/OER."

Therefore, a unique structure design is required to overcome the diffusion limitation."

Alternatively, due to the increase in defect density or synergistic effect, multi-vacancies are believed to display more attractive catalytic performance. In addition, other surface defects (e.g., grain boundaries, lattice distortion, and steps) are long-range disordered and thermodynamically unstable, which are also designed directionally to reduce the energy barrier.[76] For example, the Frank partial dislocations in metallic Co nanoparticles caused them to exhibit Pt-like ORR activity.[87] Besides, the vacancy defects on a TMC support not only changed the electronic structure and coordination environment, but also served as a \"trap\" for stabilizing metal atoms to synthesize highly dispersed catalysts.[88,89] The charge transfer effect between vacancy defects and metal atoms can prevent metal atoms from aggregation or agglomeration."

Metal-support interactions (MSIs) are the fundamental characteristic of supported catalysts, which determine their intrinsic catalytic properties. To tailor the MSIs between PGM nanoparticles and carbon supports, Yang and coworkers modified the local coordination environment around Pd nanoparticles by introducing F atoms in Pd/N-C catalysts (Fig. 9b). The introduction of the F atom pushed the N atoms towards the Pd nanoparticles, creating a more N-rich Pd surface. The rich Pd-N coordination on the Pd surface promoted the rapid adsorption of "

In addition, the armchair edges and zigzag edges are also electrochemically active, which can be further functionalized with heteroatoms to generate catalytic sites with higher intrinsic activity.

A shift in the absorption edge to high energy was clearly observed after CoP coupled with DC, implying that electron transfer occurred from the CoP core to DC shell (Fig. 11c). The interfacial charge redistribution on the CoP-DC interfacial structure led to electron accumulation at the DC surface and hole accumulation at the CoP surface, which facilitated the ORR and OER, respectively. Consequently, CoP-DC exhibited better bifunctional catalytic activity in comparison with its single components, suggesting that the interfacial charge redistribution promoted the catalytic performance. In another study, Co clusters were confined in the nanopores of porous carbon (Co/PC), leading to the formation of stable triple-phase interfaces.[66] Benefitting from the synergistic optimization of electron conduction, oxygen gas diffusion, and ion transport, the Co/PC cathode displayed a high "

Transition metal compounds (TMCs) can be directly used as oxygen catalysts, but their performance still lags behind that of noble metal catalysts. The relatively poor surface/interfacial electron transport and limited catalytic ability are the factors restricting the efficiency of TMCs for oxygen electrocatalysis. It has been observed that the electronic structures of TMCs can be regulated by varying their anions, which is reflected in their ORR/OER performances. Generally, the catalytic activity of TMC electrocatalysts mainly originates from the unsaturated atomic coordination on their surface. Therefore, the atomic-level modulation of TMC-based oxygen electrocatalysts is required to modulate their electronic structure and enhance their interaction."

Atomically dispersed metal site catalysts (ADMSCs) possess the maximum atom utilization, controllable coordination environment, and uniform exposure of active sites, which have recently attracted great attention in the field of oxygen electrocatalysis.[175,176] Different from the traditional supported nanoparticle catalysts, ADMSCs show good activity, selectivity, and stability, and have become a research hotspot. Thus far, the development of ADMSCs for the ORR/OER has witnessed substantial achievements.[177-179] The catalytic performances of ADMSCs are highly dependent on the coordination environments of their central metal atoms at the atomic level (Fig. 13a), mainly including coordination atoms, coordination numbers, chemical states, and second- or higher-coordination shells.[180,181] Compared to the coordination interaction of first-shell atoms, the second- and higher-shell atoms exhibit a lower coordination strength. In general, the common coordination number of metal atoms with N atoms is 4 because"

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) possess periodic metal atom-organic linker arrangements, large specific surface areas, tuneable pore structures, and other prominent features.[205,206] However, the low coordinative unsaturated metal sites (CUMSs) and poor conductivity of as-synthesized MOFs are the main reasons limiting their application in bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis.[207,208] Recently, MOFs have emerged as a new platform for the synthesis of TMC/C hybrids and carbon-supported ADMSCs with improved catalytic performance through carbonization.[209-211] Particularly, the atomic-level uniform distribution of metal ions in MOFs can guarantee a satisfactory dispersion of TM species embedded in the carbon matrix. As subclasses of MOFs, zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) and metal-triazolate frameworks are commonly reported.[212-214] Their organic linkers can be in situ converted into porous carbon materials through high-temperature pyrolysis. The metal salts are converted into the metallic nanoparticles or metal-"

During pyrolysis, the in situ formation of N-doped carbon provided abundant coordination sites for the stabilization of metal atoms. The metal precursor@MOF composites were pyrolyzed at high temperature to anchor ADMSCs on MOF-derived N-doped carbon. The atomic-level modulation of the coordination environment of ADMSCs can be readily achieved owing to the flexible composition design of MOFs. For example, Hu et al. synthesized a "

However, tuning the surface/interface of the electrocatalyst alone cannot fully improve the delivered performance of ZABs. This is because the actual working environment of the air cathode in ZABs is completely different from the test environment during rotating disc electrode (RDE) measurement. In half-cell experiments, the RDE minimizes the diffusion transfer resistance and reduces the concentration polarization due to the forced convection at high rotating speeds, thereby maximizing the inherent catalytic activities. However, the operating environment of the air cathode in full ZABs is generally tested under static conditions, in which the reactant diffusion resistance is a critical factor in the mass transfer efficiency. Although a series of advanced ORR/OER electrocatalysts has been developed, the stable operating current density of ZABs usually does not exceed "

To strengthen the mass transfer efficiency, the hydrophobicity and pore structure of the air cathode should be tuned, ensuring an adequate oxygen supply at the triple-phase interface.[243] The hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is often used owing to its good hydrophobicity. In addition to the hydrophobic coating function, PTFE is also a binder, protecting and separating the components from the conductive skeleton. Thus, the appropriate introduction of PTFE is also an important prerequisite for achieving a good ZAB performance. One typical method is to mix the catalyst powder, porous carbon, and polymer binder and press the slurry onto a current collector. However, the low conductivity of the polymer binder will severely decrease the active surface area and cause undesirable boundaries, resulting in poor electron transfer and mass transport. Also, the polymer binder easily decomposes during repeated cycles. Hence, the design of integrated air cathodes without polymer binder is necessary."

The asymmetric structure allowed electrolyte penetration and gas diffusion to occur simultaneously in the conductive skeleton. The 3D interconnected interface structure significantly increased the number of active sites, accelerated the mass transfer, and enhanced the reactive interface stability. Therefore, the asymmetric air cathode had a lower charging-discharging voltage gap in the range of "

The key challenges associated with alkaline ZABs are closely related to the strong alkaline environment, resulting in poor cycling behaviour and low electrochemical reversibility owing to the instability of the electrolyte|electrode interface and the parasitic reactions, requiring the rational design of ZAB electrolytes.[255] On the other hand, aqueous electrolytes have good fluidity, but cannot meet the needs of flexible and stretchable ZABs. Replacing aqueous electrolytes with GPEs or anion exchange membranes (AEMs) can realize the mechanical flexibility of ZABs. In this section, we mainly focus on the recent achievements of ZAB electrolytes and provide an in-depth understanding behind their high performance, which is expected to advance practical implementations."

A further increase in the KOH concentration clearly increased the viscosity, thus restraining the transfer of electrolyte ions. Besides, the high concentration KOH electrolyte hampered the diffusion of O2 in the gas-liquid-solid three-phase interface, thus decreasing the current density in the concentration polarization region. Therefore, 6 M KOH provided balanced ionic transportation and O2 supply, resulting in the optimal discharging behaviour of ZABs. Zhi's group revealed that the dependence between concentration and freezing point of KOH electrolyte was determined by the synergistic effect of H-bond quantity, H-bond strength, and ion interactions.265 Experimentally, 8 M KOH manifested the lowest freezing point of "

The ZABs based on the two-electron oxygen reaction could work in two modes, i.e., the full charging mode based on the four-electron reaction path achieved"

The crosslinking degree of hydrogels affects the mechanical strength and elasticity.

In general, most synthetic processes include thermal-induced free radical polymerization or photo-excited free radical polymerization, which largely depends on the choice of initiator.[290] Many GPEs are synthesized via the polymerization of monomers to obtain polymer hosts, and then soaked in the corresponding aqueous electrolyte to get the targeted GPEs.[291] The amorphous phase in GPEs enables fast ion transport through the hydrated regions.[208] Here, some evaluation indexes are required to consider. Water uptake is the adsorption capacity of the polymer host for the aqueous electrolyte. The high water content of GPEs facilitates the ionic conduction and promotes the fast reaction kinetics. Ionic conductivity is a very important indicator, which strongly relies on the degree of hydration and ion-exchange capacities. Besides, when the polymer host is in the amorphous state, the segmental motions in the polymer chains increase the ion mobility. A high ionic conductivity ensures that the ion diffusion rate can catch up with the electrochemical reaction rate, which is an important prerequisite for achieving high-rate ZABs. To meet the temperature-adaptive requirements, the solid-liquid transition point and the glass transition temperature need to be measured. Flexible ZABs need to face complex mechanical forces and deformations. The excellent mechanical properties with both high stress and strain behaviour of GPE are essential. GPEs can be stretched over several times of their original length without breaking. The reliability of the contact between the electrolyte and electrodes puts forward higher requirements for the adhesion properties of GPEs. Their excellent adhesion behaviour enables them to be tightly bonded with the electrodes, thereby eliminating the need for fixation tools."

Owing to the higher negative redox potential of Zn metal than that of hydrogen, self-corrosion often occurs in alkaline media. Alkaline electrolyte has very high reaction activity for the Zn anode. The self-corrosion can also be regarded as the self-discharge phenomenon of the battery. The anode corrosion rate is highly linked with the pH of the electrolyte.[319] In weak acidic or neutral electrolyte systems, the self-corrosion phenomenon is less severe. The electrochemical corrosion mentioned here refers to the irreversible consumption of Zn metal in repeated charging/ discharging cycles, mainly including the Zn dropped from the anode into electrolyte and inert byproducts. Because these irreversible byproducts have low solubility and poor conductivity, they are easily saturated in the electrolyte and deposited on the surface of the Zn anode, reducing its active sites and reaction surface area, which is called passivation. As commonly observed, the cycling stability of ZABs is adversely affected by either self-corrosion or electrochemical corrosion. Thus, the corrosion of the Zn anode is unavoidable without protection. In this case, to retard corrosion, corrosion inhibitors (e.g., In, Bi, Pb, Sn, "

In contrast, the surface morphology of the Zn powder changed significantly during the first charging-discharging process. In a Zn-air coin cell, the nanoporous Zn anode achieved enhanced charging-discharging behaviour (Fig. 23c) and high energy efficiency after 80 cycles. Besides, 3D printing (3DP) technology is attractive to synthesize functional porous Zn electrodes. A 3DP Zn electrode (3DP-Zn-E) was directly printed using a mixture ink of Zn powder, carbon black, CNF, PVDF, and certain of solvent.[328] The 3DP-Zn-E featured porosity with micro-architectures, while maintaining the same crystal structure. The large square holes with a lot of Zn microspheres for 3DP-Zn-E enlarged its active area in comparison with the conventional Zn plate. These Zn microspheres connected to CNF also increased the mechanical strength and electrical conductivity of the 3DP-Zn-E electrodes. The buffering and limiting effects of 3DP-Zn-E inhibited the formation of Zn dendrites during the cycling process, leading to a high utilization of Zn and high energy density in ZABs."

Qian and coworkers proposed a chemical buffer layer coated on a Zn metal anode (CBL@Zn) to improve the Zn reversibility. ZnO nanorods were uniformly dispersed in the GO skeleton, acting as a unique chemical buffer layer (Fig. 24b). The synergistic effect between the adsorption affinity of GO and role played by the nuclei of the ZnO nanorods alleviated the interfacial passivation and dissolution by regulating the reversible precipitation-dissolution behaviour of ZnO. The symmetrical CBL@Zn||CBL@Zn cell achieved a good stability of 100 cycles with small voltage fluctuation (Fig. 24c). With an increase in the deposition time of "

An in situ optical visualization platform deepened the understanding of the dynamic evolution of the electrolyte|Zn interface (Fig. 27d).371 The interface stability was strongly correlated with the corrosion, dendrite growth, and HER. For example, a smooth interface of electrolyte|Zn was noticed when DMSO was added to the aqueous electrolyte, whereas severe Zn dendrites appeared in the DMSO-free electrolyte.103 A stable electrochemical interface enabled robust cycling stability even at high cycling rates. Cui and coworkers changed the viscosity to simulate the gel process of alkaline electrolyte and recorded the electrodeposition process of zincate ions on the planar Zn anode with different times (Fig. 27e).371 The growth process of Zn dendrites was visualized, together with a change in Zn deposition from uniform to uneven. The Zn electrodeposition process was divided into uniform and non-uniform regions. High current and high viscosity rendered the deposited Zn thinner and compact in the uniform region. This is because the high current provided enough driving force for deposition. The increase in viscosity hindered the ion transport, which made the distance effect more obvious. In addition to aqueous electrolytes, GPEs also showed considerable suppression of Zn dendrite growth, facilitating an excellent GPE|Zn interface by modulating the H-bond network.

It is well known that the smooth operation of ZABs is closely related to the interface stability of the air cathode|electrolyte|Zn anode. Based on combined in situ characterization (in situ XAFS, in situ XRD, in situ TEM, and in situ Raman) and finite element analysis (FEA) technology, it is possible to deeply explore the evolution of the electrolyte|electrode interface during the cycling process. Furthermore, researchers can study various the possible failure mechanisms of ZABs using these techniques. Compared to the air cathode, a rational design of Zn anodes with high utilization is an essential step toward practical electrochemical energy storage devices."

However, the properties related to their low-temperature and high-temperature performances are rarely reported. At a low temperature, the reduced ionic conductivity of the electrolyte and the low critical current density are the main problems. At a high temperature, the parasitic HER and electrolyte evaporation have been identified as the main bottleneck, resulting in a low energy efficiency. To date, the research and knowledge on temperature-adaptive ZAB systems are still in their infancy and require urgent development, including performance breakthroughs and theoretical innovations. For example, the development of strategies to improve the transport kinetics of ions in the electrolyte and the diffusion in the electrodes at low temperatures is highly desirable but remains a significant challenge."

To promote the healthy development of this field, we propose the establishment of a standardized testing process (similar to Li-ion batteries). The key performance parameters (e.g., specific capacity, energy density, and cycling number) at high current densities should be encouraged, which have more reference values for practical application. In addition to oxygen electrocatalysts, the fundamental research on ZAB electrolytes and Zn anodes deserves increased attention."
