With the recent interest in video understanding, embodied autonomous agents, text-to-image generation, and multisensor fusion in application domains such as healthcare and robotics, multimodal machine learning has brought unique computational and theoretical challenges to the machine learning community given the heterogeneity of data sources and the interconnections often found between modalities. However, the breadth of progress in multimodal research has made it difficult to identify the common themes and open questions in the field. By synthesizing a broad range of application domains and theoretical frameworks from both historical and recent perspectives, this article is designed to provide an overview of the computational and theoretical foundations of multimodal machine learning. We start by defining three key principles of modality heterogeneity, connections, and interactions that have driven subsequent innovations, and propose a taxonomy of six core technical challenges: representation, alignment, reasoning, generation, transference, and quantification covering historical and recent trends. Recent technical achievements will be presented through the lens of this taxonomy, allowing researchers to understand the similarities and differences across new approaches. We end by motivating several open problems for future research as identified by our taxonomy."

By synthesizing a broad range of research, this article is designed to provide an overview of the methodological, computational, and theoretical foundations of multimodal machine learning. We begin by defining (in Section 2) three key principles that have driven technical challenges and innovations: (1) modalities are heterogeneous because the information present often shows diverse qualities, structures, and representations, (2) modalities are connected since they are often related and share commonalities, and (3) modalities interact to give rise to new information when used for task inference. Building upon these principles, we propose a new taxonomy of six core challenges in multimodal learning: representation, alignment, reasoning, generation, transference, and quantification (see Figure 1). These core multimodal challenges are understudied in conventional unimodal machine learning and need to be tackled in order to progress the field forward:"

For example, modalities include speech and audio recorded through microphones, images and videos captured via cameras, and force and vibrations captured via haptic sensors. Modalities can be placed along a spectrum from raw to abstract: raw modalities are those more closely detected from a sensor, such as speech recordings from a microphone or images captured by a camera. Abstract modalities are those farther away from sensors, such as language extracted from speech recordings, objects detected from images, or even abstract concepts like sentiment intensity and object categories."

From a research perspective, multimodal entails the computational study of heterogeneous and interconnected (connections + interactions) modalities. Firstly, modalities are heterogeneous because the information present in different modalities will often show diverse qualities, structures, and representations. Secondly, these modalities are not independent entities but rather share connections due to complementary information. Thirdly, modalities interact in different ways when they are integrated for a task. We expand on these three foundational principles of multimodal research in the following subsections."

Heterogeneity should be seen as a spectrum: two images from the same camera that capture the same view modulo camera wear and tear are closer to homogeneous, two different languages that capture the same meaning but are different depending on language families are slightly heterogeneous, language and vision are even more heterogeneous, and so on. In this section, we present a non-exhaustive list of dimensions of heterogeneity (see Figure 2 for an illustration). These dimensions are complementary and may overlap; each multimodal problem likely involves heterogeneity in multiple dimensions."

The presence of shared information is often in contrast to unique information that exists solely in a single modality [367]. Modality connections describe the extent and dimensions to which information can be shared across modalities. When reasoning about the connections in multimodal data, it is helpful to think about both bottom-up (statistical) and top-down (semantic) approaches (see Figure 3). From a statistical data-driven perspective, connections are identified from distributional patterns in multimodal data, while semantic approaches define connections based on our domain knowledge about how modalities share and contain unique information."

For example, two elements may co-occur with each other, resulting in a higher frequency of both occurring at the same time. Statistically, this could lead to correlation—the degree to which elements are linearly related, or other non-linear associations. From a data-driven perspective, discovering which elements are associated with each other is important for modeling the joint distributions across modalities during multimodal representation and alignment [331]."

Typically, while statistical association can be estimated purely from data, understanding the nature of statistical dependence requires some knowledge of the elements and their underlying relationships [242, 343]."

In Figure 4, we provide a high-level illustration of some dimensions of interactions that can exist."

However, computing tensor products is expensive since their dimension scales exponentially with the number of modalities, so several efficient approximations based on low-rank decomposition have been proposed [127, 205]. Finally, MI generalize additive and multiplicative operators to include learnable parameters that capture second-order interactions [148]. In its most general form, MI defines a bilinear product "

Nevertheless, Barnum et al. [30] demonstrated robustness benefits of fusion at early stages, while Gadzicki et al. [98] also found that complex early fusion can outperform abstract fusion. To account for the greater heterogeneity during complex early fusion, many approaches rely on generic encoders that are applicable to both modalities, such as convolutional layers [30, 98] and Transformers [194, 198]. However, do these complex non-additive fusion models actually learn non-additive interactions between modality elements? Not necessarily, according to Hessel and Lee [121]. We cover these fundamental analysis questions and more in the quantification challenge (Section 8)."

For example, these models would encourage the representation of the word \"dog\" and an image of a dog to be close (i.e., semantically positive pairs), while the distance between the word \"dog\" and an image of a car to be far apart (i.e., semantically negative pairs) [95]. The coordination distance is typically cosine distance [225] or max-margin losses [131]. Recent work has explored large-scale representation coordination by scaling up contrastive learning of image and text pairs [268], and also found that contrastive learning provably captures redundant information across the two views [328, 332] (but not non-redundant information). In addition to contrastive learning, several approaches instead learn a coordinated space by mapping corresponding data from one modality to another [88]. For example, Socher et al. [304] map image embeddings into word embedding spaces for zero-shot image classification.

This section covers recent work in multimodal alignment involving (1) discrete alignment: identifying connections between discrete elements across modalities, (2) continuous alignment: modeling alignment between continuous modality signals with ambiguous segmentation, and (3) contextualized representations: learning better multimodal representations by capturing cross-modal interactions between elements (Figure 9)."

When we have supervised data in the form of connected modality pairs, contrastive learning is a popular approach where the goal is to match representations of the same concept expressed in different modalities [29]. Several objective functions for learning aligned spaces from varying quantities of paired [50, 136] and unpaired [110] data have been proposed. Many of the ideas that enforce strong [95, 196] or partial [21, 352, 407] representation coordination (Section 3.2) are also applicable for local alignment. Several examples include aligning books with their corresponding movies/scripts [416], matching"

Optimal transport (OT)-based approaches [354] (which belong to a broader set of matching algorithms) are a potential solution since they jointly optimize the coordination function and optimal coupling between modality elements by posing alignment as a divergence minimization problem. These approaches are useful for aligning multimodal representation spaces [182, 266]. To alleviate computational issues, several recent advances have integrated them with neural networks [64], approximated OT with entropy regularization [365], and formulated convex relaxations for efficient learning [110]."

Adversarial training is a popular approach to warp one representation space into another. Initially used in domain adaptation [33], adversarial training learns a domain-invariant representation across domains where a domain classifier is unable to identify which domain a feature came from [12]. These ideas have been extended to align multimodal spaces [129, 132, 234]. Hsu et al. [129] use adversarial training to align images and medical reports, Hu et al. [132] design an adversarial network for cross-modal retrieval, and Munro and Damen [234] design both self-supervised alignment and adversarial alignment objectives for multimodal action recognition. Dynamic time warping (DTW) [167] segments and aligns multi-view time-series data by maximizing their similarity via time warping (inserting frames) such that they are aligned across time. For multimodal tasks, it is necessary to design similarity metrics between modalities [22, 323], such as combining DTW with CCA or other coordination functions [335]."

Clustering-based discretization has recently emerged as an important preprocessing step for generalizing language-based pretraining (with clear word/byte pair segmentation boundaries and discrete elements) to video or audio-based pretraining (without clear segmentation boundaries and continuous elements). By clustering raw video or audio features into a discrete set, approaches such as VideoBERT [314] perform masked pretraining on raw video and audio data. Similarly, approaches such as DALL.E [273], VQ-VAE [347], and CMCM [202] also utilize discretized intermediate layers obtained via vector quantization and showed benefits in modality alignment."

This is commonly referred to in the literature as unimodal, bimodal, trimodal interactions, and so on [215]. Joint undirected alignment is typically captured by parameterizing models with alignment layers and training end-to-end for a multimodal task. These alignment layers can include attention weights [56], tensor products [205, 396], and MI [148]. More recently, transformer models [349] have emerged as powerful encoders for sequential data by automatically aligning and capturing complementary features at different timesteps. Building upon the initial text-based transformer model, multimodal transformers have been proposed that perform joint alignment using a full self-attention over modality elements concatenated across the sequence dimension (i.e., early fusion) [180, 314]. As a result, all modality elements become jointly connected to all other modality elements similarly (i.e., modeling all connections using dot-product similarity kernels)."

For example, temporal attention models use alignment as a latent step to improve many sequence-based tasks [376, 405]. These attention mechanisms are typically directed from the output to the input so that the resulting weights reflect a soft alignment distribution over the input. Multimodal transformers perform directed alignment using query-key-value attention mechanisms to attend from one modality's sequence to another, before repeating in a bidirectional manner.

These models typically build on top of pretrained language models [269], pretrained visual encoders [83] combined with an alignment layer. Alignment can be done via end-to-end training with multimodal transformers [380] (e.g., Flamingo [15], OpenFlamingo [27], Kosmos [259]), or keeping the language and vision parts frozen and only training a post-hoc alignment layer (e.g., MiniGPT-4 [413], BLIP-2 [179], InstructBLIP [73], LLaMA-Adapter V2 [100]). Self-supervised pretraining has emerged as an effective way to train these architectures to learn general-purpose representations from larger-scale unlabeled multimodal data before transferring to specific downstream tasks via supervised fine-tuning [84, 180, 413]. Pretraining objectives typically consist of unimodal language modeling [269, 270], image-to-text or text-to-image alignment [120, 413], and multimodal instruction tuning [73, 203, 210]. We refer the reader to recent survey papers discussing these large vision-language models in more detail [86, 99]."

Hierarchical structure is present in many tasks involving language syntax, visual syntax, or higher-order reasoning. These approaches typically construct a graph based on predefined node and edge categories before using (heterogeneous variants of) graph neural networks to capture a representation of structure [298], such as using language syntactic structure to guide visual modules that discover specific information in images [20, 69]. Graph-based reasoning approaches have been applied for visual commonsense reasoning [200], visual question answering [284], machine translation [391], recommendation systems [322], web image search [358], and social media analysis [288]."

Explicit memory mechanisms have emerged as a popular choice to accumulate multimodal information across time so that long-range cross-modal interactions can be captured through storage and retrieval from memory. Rajagopalan et al. [272] explore various memory representations including multimodal fusion, coordination, and factorization. Insights from key-value memory [376] and attention-based memory [397] have also been successfully applied to applications including question answering, video captioning, emotion recognition, and sentiment analysis."

Typically formalized by the sequential decision-making framework, the challenge lies in maximizing long-term cumulative reward despite only interacting with the environment through short-term actions [316]. To tackle the challenges of interactive reasoning, the growing research field of multimodal RL has emerged from the intersection of language understanding, embodiment in the visual world, deep RL, and robotics. We refer the reader to the extensive survey paper by Luketina et al. [211] and the position paper by Bisk et al. [39] for a full review of this field. Luketina et al. [211] separate the literature into multimodal-conditional RL (in which multimodal interaction is necessitated by the problem formulation itself, such as instruction following [56, 364]) and language-assisted RL (in which multimodal data is optionally used to facilitate learning, such as reading instruction manuals [238])."

While advances in local representation fusion (such as additive, multiplicative, tensor-based, attention-based, and sequential fusion, see Section 3.1 for a full review) are also generally applicable here, the goal of reasoning is to be more interpretable in the inference process through domain knowledge about the multimodal problem. To that end, we cover recent directions in explicitly modeling the inference process via logical and causal operators as examples of recent trends in this direction."

For example, Yi et al. [390] propose the CLEVRR benchmark focusing on four specific elements of reasoning on videos: descriptive (e.g., \"what color\"), explanatory (\"what's responsible for\"), predictive (\"what will happen next\"), and counterfactual (\"what if\"). Beyond CLEVRR, recent work has also proposed Causal VQA [6] and Counterfactual VQA [243] to measure the robustness of VQA models under controlled interventions to the question as a step toward mitigating language bias in VQA models. Methods inspired by integrating causal reasoning capabilities into neural network models have also been shown to improve robustness and reduce biases [360]."

Multimodal knowledge graphs are important because they enable the grounding of structured information in the visual and physical world. For example, Liu et al. [204] construct multimodal knowledge graphs containing both numerical features and images for entities. Visual Genome is another example containing dense annotations of objects, attributes, and relationships in images and text [165]. These multimodal knowledge bases have been shown to benefit visual question answering [372, 417], knowledge base completion [261], and image captioning [226]. Gui et al. [111] integrates knowledge into vision-and-language transformers for automatic reasoning over both knowledge sources. Another promising approach is multimodal knowledge expansion [267, 373, 383] using knowledge distillation to expand knowledge from unimodal data to multimodal settings. We refer the reader to a comprehensive survey by Zhu et al. [415] for additional references."

Recent work has explored various input modalities to guide text summarization, such as images [61], video [181], and audio [90, 147, 177]. Recent trends in multimodal summarization include extractive and abstractive approaches. Extractive approaches aim to filter words, phrases, and other unimodal elements from the input to create a summary [62, 147, 177]. Beyond text as output, video summarization is the task of producing a compact version of the video (visual summary) by encapsulating the most informative parts [282]. Li et al. [177] collected a dataset of news videos and articles paired with manually annotated summaries as a benchmark toward multimodal summarization. Finally, UzZaman et al. [346] aim to simplify complex sentences by extracting multimodal summaries for accessibility. On the other hand, abstractive approaches define a generative model to generate the summary at multiple levels of granularity [61, 183]. Although most approaches only focus on generating a textual summary from multimodal data [250], several directions have also explored generating summarized images to supplement the generated textual summary [61, 181]."

For example, generating a descriptive caption of an image can help improve the accessibility of visual content for blind people [113]. Multimodal translation brings about new difficulties involving the generation of high-dimensional structured data as well as their evaluation. Recent approaches can be classified as exemplar-based, which are limited to retrieving from training instances to translate between modalities but guarantee fidelity [92], and generative models which can translate into arbitrary instances interpolating beyond the data but face challenges in quality, diversity, and evaluation [161, 273, 341]. Despite these challenges, recent progress in large-scale generative models has yielded impressive results in text-to-image [273, 278], text-to-video [302], audio-to-image [146], text-to-speech [276], speech-to-gesture [10], speaker-to-listener [240], language to pose [11], and speech and music generation [7, 72, 245]."

This conditional decoding process is extremely challenging since it needs to be (1) conditional: preserve semantically meaningful mappings from the initial seed to a series of long-range parallel modalities, (2) synchronized: semantically coherent across modalities, (3) stochastic: capture many possible future generations given a particular state, and (4) auto-regressive across possibly long ranges. Many modalities have been considered as targets for creation. Language generation has been explored"

While the ideal way to evaluate generated content is through user studies, it is time-consuming, costly, and can potentially introduce subjectivity bias [105]. Several automatic proxy metrics have been proposed [19, 63] by none are universally robust across many generation tasks."

How can knowledge learned from a secondary modality (e.g., predicted labels or representation) help a model trained on a primary modality? We call this challenge transference, since the transfer of information from the secondary modality gives rise to new behaviors previously unseen in the primary modality. We identify three types of approaches: (1) cross-modal transfer, (2) multimodal co-learning, and (3) model induction (Figure 16)."

Related work has also adapted prefix tuning for image captioning [59], multimodal fusion [116], and summarization [393]. While prefix tuning is simple and efficient, it provides the user with only limited control over how information is transferred. Representation tuning goes a level deeper by modifying the inner representations of the language model via contextualization with other modalities. For example, Ziegler et al. [418] include"

Several models such as Perceiver [144], MultiModel [152], ViT-BERT [184], and PolyViT [198] have explored the possibility of using the same unimodal encoder architecture for different inputs across unimodal tasks (i.e., language, image, video, or audio-only). The Transformer architecture has emerged as a popular choice due to its suitability for serialized inputs such as text (sequence of tokens) [81], images (sequence of patches) [83], video (sequence of images) [314], and other time-series data (sequence of timesteps) [199]. There have also been several attempts to build a single model that works well on a suite of multimodal tasks, including both not limited to HighMMT [194], VATT [13], FLAVA [303], and Gato [275]."

Typically, this involves adding secondary modalities during the training process, designing a suitable representation space, and investigating how the multimodal model transfers to the primary modality during testing. For example, DeViSE learns a coordinated space between image and text to improve image classification [95]. Marino et al. [222] use knowledge graphs for image classification via a graph-based joint representation. Jia et al. [149] improve image classifiers with contrastive learning between images and noisy captions. Finally, Zadeh et al. [398] showed that implicit co-learning is also possible without explicit co-learning objectives."

There are two general ways of doing so. The first is co-training, where each unimodal model's predictions are used to pseudo-label new unlabeled examples in the other modality, thereby enlarging the training set of the other modality [40]. The second is co-regularization [301, 308], in which the predictions from separate unimodal classifiers are regularized to be similar, thereby encouraging both classifiers to share information (i.e., redundancy). Therefore, information is transferred across modalities through model predictions instead of shared representation spaces."

Recent work can be categorized into (1) interpretable methods that explicitly model how each modality is used [252, 338, 400] or (2) post-hoc explanations of black-box models [53, 109]. In the former, methods such as Concept Bottleneck Models [162] and fitting sparse linear layers [368] or decision trees [356] on top of deep feature representations have emerged as promising choices. In the latter, gradient-based visualizations [109, 290, 300]) and feature attributions (e.g., modality contribution [103], LIME [277], and Shapley values [227]) have been used to highlight regions of modality importance."

Each modality has a unique noise topology, which determines the distribution of noise and imperfections that it commonly encounters. For example, images are susceptible to blurs and shifts, typed text is susceptible to typos following keyboard positions, and multimodal time-series data is susceptible to correlated imperfections across synchronized timesteps. Liang et al. [195] collect a comprehensive set of targeted noisy distributions unique to each modality. In addition to natural noise topologies [173, 213], related work has also explored adversarial attacks [82] and distribution shifts [93] in multimodal systems. Finally, there have been recent efforts on incomplete multimodal learning [194, 214, 359, 388] to account for noisy or missing modalities, such as modality imputation using probabilistic models [214], autoencoders [333], translation models [262], low-rank approximations [192], or knowledge distillation [359], or training general models with a wide range of modalities so they can still operate on partial subsets [194, 275]. However, they may run the risk of possible error compounding and require knowing which modalities are imperfect beforehand."

                                    "content": "Interactions: One common categorization of interactions involves redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy [367]. Redundancy describes task-relevant information shared among features, uniqueness studies the task-relevant information present in only one of the features, and synergy investigates the emergence of new information when both features are present. From a statistical perspective, measures of redundancy include mutual information [28, 40] and contrastive learning estimators [332, 339]. Other approaches have studied these measures in isolation, such as redundancy via distance between prediction logits using either feature [224], statistical distribution tests on input features [26], or via human annotations [281]. From the semantic view, recent work in Causal VQA [6] and Counterfactual VQA [243] seek to understand the interactions captured by trained models by measuring their robustness under controlled semantic edits to the question or image. Finally, recent work has formalized definitions of non-additive interactions to quantify their presence in trained models [307, 340, 382]. Parallel research such as EMAP [121], DIME [212], M2Lens [363], and MultiViz [193] take a more visual approach to visualize the interactions in real-world multimodal datasets and models through higher-order gradient activations of learned representations. Despite this, accurately visualizing multimodal information and interactions remains a challenge due to the brittleness of interpretation methods [106], difficulty in evaluation [166], and challenges in extending visualization methods to applications such as biomedical data integration, imaging, intelligent systems, and user interfaces."

Therefore, one often needs to balance the utility of additional modalities with the additional complexity in data collection and modeling [195] as well as increased susceptibility to noise and imperfection in the additional modality [262]. How can we formally quantify the utility and risks of each input modality, while balancing these tradeoffs for reliable real-world usage? There have been several attempts toward formalizing the semantics of a multimodal representation and how these benefits can transfer to downstream tasks [188, 325, 339], while information-theoretic arguments have also provided useful insights [40, 308]."

Can we come up with formal guidelines to compare these tradeoffs and select modalities? Explainability and interpretability. Before models can be safely used by real-world stakeholders in domains such as medicine, autonomous systems, and user interfaces, we need to understand how to interpret their inner workings. How can we evaluate whether these phenomena are accurately interpreted? These challenges are exacerbated for relatively understudied modalities beyond language and vision, where the modalities themselves are not easy to visualize. Finally, how can we tailor these explanations, possibly in a human-in-the-loop manner, to inform real-world decision-making? There are also challenges in quantifying modality and social biases and robustness to imperfect, noisy, and out-of-distribution modalities."
