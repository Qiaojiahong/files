However, the recently emerged field of optical metasurfaces provides a novel platform for studying nonlinear phenomena in planar geometries. Nonlinear optical metasurfaces introduce new functionalities to the field of nonlinear optics extending them beyond perturbative regimes of harmonic generation and parametric frequency conversion, being driven by mode-matching, resonances, and relaxed phase-matching conditions. Here we review the very recent advances in the rapidly developing field of nonlinear metasurface photonics, emphasizing multi-frequency and cascading effects, asymmetric and chiral frequency conversion, nonperturbative nonlinear regimes, and nonlinear quantum photonics, empowered by the physics of Mie resonances and optical bound states in the continuum. © 2023 Chinese Laser Press"

Metasurfaces have come a long way in the last few decades, first as a two-dimensional realization of metamaterials [1,2] and then expanding rapidly in both design and applications far beyond the initial demonstrations, showing many fascinating phenomena with nanostructured surfaces and facilitating unique functionalities for a variety of practical applications [3,4]. Importantly, the fabrication capabilities and theoretical understanding have matured during that period to provide a solid background for the exploration of new concepts with metasurfaces [5]. Current efforts of many groups are focused on the study of tunable and active metasurfaces, including flexible control of structured light [6], which are expected to boost a range of metasurface applications in sensing technologies and light detection and ranging (LIDAR), augmented reality and dynamic holography, as well as many other applications discussed in this special issue."

They can combine various hybrid or composite materials such as graphene and two-dimensional single-layer semiconductors, promising novel opportunities for the exploration of nonlinear effects, generating nonlinear responses far beyond those of natural materials. The ability to design single \"meta-atoms\" and their arrays at will opens the way towards efficient engineering of the spatial nonlinear phase of the metasurfaces for the study of spin-controlled nonlinear interactions, directional nonlinear scattering, and nonreciprocal and topological effects."

Furthermore, while having highly resonant modes at all frequencies involved in the nonlinear process is desirable, it is not enough since the enhancement of nonlinear generation also depends on the spatial overlap of the electromagnetic field distributions with respect to the symmetry conditions imposed by the nonlinear tensor. The role of the electromagnetic field overlap is prominent between the two modes employed in frequency mixing processes such as SFG [35] and FWM [22,36] since it significantly affects the efficiency of the generated nonlinear process. However, for SHG and THG in metasurfaces, its role is diminished due to the high number of Mie modes excited at shorter wavelengths, which makes the field profile quite complex with a large variety of components."

So far, only hBN-based metasurfaces that support BIC resonances were experimentally realized [34]. One of the reasons can be difficulty in fabrication process development since each sample is unique, and its optical properties depend on an exfoliated flake. The lateral size of the flake is typically a few tens of micrometers—such a small working area and uncertainty of exfoliated flake thickness complicate the process, increase the fabrication time, and limit the repeatability and desirable control of the nanostructure design."

However, there has been a debate about the nature of these processes: is it a pure frequency multiplication, or do cascaded nonlinearities play a role? One of the recent works [81] explores this question and analyzes SHG and THG processes in a GaAs metasurface in conjunction with polarization selection rules and crystal symmetries [Fig. 1(d)]. The authors demonstrate different contributions to the signal at the THG frequency and show that a significant part of it originates from the mixing fundamental wavelength with the surface second harmonic. This work experimentally confirms the importance of surface nonlinearities in nonlinear metasurfaces and shows that further analyses could provide additional control over nonlinear frequency mixing."

[73] the authors highlight this question and show that in metasurfaces the THG process can be enabled by a phase-locking mechanism between the pump and the inhomogeneous portion of the third-harmonic signal [87,88]. The propagation of this inhomogeneous THG component is not affected by the material dispersion and absorption at the THG wavelength, thus enabling efficient frequency conversion in the absorptive region. This theory is quite intriguing and is incredibly important for vacuum-UV light generation, where only a few nanometers of material are expected to contribute to harmonic generation. We hope to see further experiments that can provide additional insight to this theory."

The record-breaking efficiencies of nonlinear harmonics achieved in metasurfaces [27,28] utilize BICs that rely on symmetry breaking, either by using asymmetric geometries of nanoresonators [89] or by using a non-normal incident angle. One of the recent works [29] demonstrates that BICs can be achieved in metasurfaces by using magnetic dipole resonances coupled to a mirror. The introduced design does not require broken symmetry or depend on incident polarization: it is an array of silicon nanodisks that sits on top of a thin dielectric layer with a mirror underneath [Fig. 1(e)]. To show the performance of the metasurface, the authors demonstrate THG that benefits from the strongly enhanced electric field at BIC resonance. Measured THG efficiencies are the highest reported so far using femtosecond laser pulses, "

For example, Marino et al. [82] demonstrate a GaAs metasurface that consists of three layers of nanodisks [Fig. 1(f)]. When the metasurface is pumped at its magnetic dipole resonance, the use of a few layers improves the SHG efficiency by 15 times with respect to its one-layer counterpart. Despite increased complexity in the fabrication of multilayered nanostructures, we believe that it is a feasible direction in nonlinear metaoptics since it increases the interaction length of the fundamental pump with the material that can enhance the nonlinear generation and provide an additional degree of freedom to control nonlinear generation."

Nonreciprocity arises in various branches of physics, where it underpins many phenomena and applications [104]. A nonreciprocal system is defined as a system that exhibits different received-transmitted field ratios when its source and detector are exchanged. In electromagnetism, nonreciprocity was first experimented by Faraday in 1845, explicitly described by Stokes in 1840 and by Helmholtz in 1856, reformulated by Kirchhoff in 1860, anticipated in nonlinear media by Rayleigh in 1873, and extensively applied by Planck in 1900 in connection with blackbody radiation [104]."

In both of those cases, it results from breaking time-reversal symmetry, by an external bias force in the linear case, and by a combination of self-biasing and structural asymmetry in the nonlinear case [104]. In the nonlinear case, nonreciprocity can be realized with nonlinear light-matter interaction in metasurfaces as was suggested theoretically a few years ago [105,106].

These asymmetric effects originate from magnetoelectric coupling and asymmetrical field enhancement. In the linear regime, breaking symmetry of all-dielectric nanoparticles led to geometrically tunable magnetoelectric coupling and different backscattering scenarios [107]. These theoretical predictions were verified in experiment [108] for bianisotropic particles supporting both electric and magnetic Mie-type resonances, revealing that the particle with broken symmetry exhibits different backscattering for the opposite excitation directions. A metasurface composed of such bianisotropic particles demonstrates that the metasurface is characterized by different reflection phases when being excited from the opposite directions [108]."

The authors demonstrated that the theoretical ratio of second-harmonic power for the forward and backward illuminations can be increased by around four orders of magnitude. This effect is obtained by altering geometrical parameters that coincide with q-BIC resonances. They argued that this directional generation of higher-order waves can be potentially useful for nonlinear holograms."

With these bianisotropic metasurfaces, the third harmonic is generated asymmetrically for two different propagation directions.

This is achieved by introducing a nonlinear Kerr-like response demonstrating that for certain input intensities the metasurface can become highly nonreciprocal, allowing large transmission in one direction and low transmission in the other. The first experimental demonstration of such nonlinearity-induced nonreciprocity in free-space metasurfaces has been reported just recently by Cotrufo et al. [113] who implemented this concept for free-space radiation using silicon metasurfaces supporting asymmetric q-BIC resonances."

An object is called chiral when its mirror image cannot be superimposed with the original object, and many examples of chirality can be found at all scales in nature, from organisms to biomolecules and amino acids, which often occur only in one handedness. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was suggested as a powerful optical technique for the study of chiral materials and molecules. It gives access to an enantioselective signal based on the differential absorption of right and left circularly polarized light. In natural media, chiral effects are weak, so that chiral plasmonic structures and chiral metamaterials were suggested as a new tool for achieving strong chiroptical responses [114]."

[118] engineered a chiral silicon metasurface with L-shaped meta-atoms for enhanced nonlinear chiroptical response of THG, as shown in Fig. 3(d). They demonstrated theoretically and observed in experiment the pronounced circular dichroism (CD) at the Mie and q-BIC resonances. The transmission spectra for LCP and RCP pumps demonstrate the increase of linear chirality in the vicinity of the resonances [118]. In addition, strong nonlinear chiroptical response associated with high efficiency of the THG leads to large"

However, sufficiently intense light can temporarily modify optical properties of the material proportional to the amplitude of the incident light. Such strong light-matter interaction regimes can lead to novel phenomena, such as an induced shift of the frequency of the generated harmonics, multiphoton absorption, as well as the generation of higher harmonics with relatively strong intensities. Recent progress in the physics of resonances supported by dielectric metasurfaces allows experimental observation of such effects, due to the energy concentrations on scales smaller than the wavelength of light. As discussed in the recent review paper [120], engineered optical resonances play an important role in the field of nanoscale nonlinear optics, and they can intensify"

Zograf et al. [122] designed silicon metasurfaces supporting q-BIC resonances in the mid-IR frequency range. The BIC resonance at the fundamental wave allows strong energy concentration in the metasurfaces boosting the generation of higher harmonics, namely from third to eleventh odd optical harmonics extending through the near-IR to the visible spectral ranges, as shown in Fig. 4(c). They confirmed that the observed harmonic generation originates from the power enhancement realized for the optimal metasurface geometry, and they have studied the dependence of the fifth harmonic on the pump, with a deviation from the perturbative regime. Zograf et al. [122] observed a dramatic efficiency enhancement and spectral narrowing of the high-harmonic generation for varying the pump pulse duration from the subpicosecond to the picosecond regime."

The mechanisms responsible for the generation of nonperturbative odd and even high-order harmonics are currently under debate and attributed to different quantum phenomena in semiconductors, such as intraband and interband transitions [127], quantum interference and interplay of direct (from valence to conduction band) and indirect (involving multiple bands) transitions [128], but also transition dipole amplitude and phases [125] and a finite Berry phase [129]. These effects can be explored"

In particular, Xiao et al. [132] (see also Ref. [133]) suggested theoretically a novel approach for dynamically switchable high-harmonic generation metasurfaces by exploiting polarization-controlled dual BIC resonances. They calculated numerically efficient third- and fifth-harmonic generation from direct parametric processes and cascaded processes based on degenerate FWM. They demonstrated that the BIC resonances and generated harmonics enhanced resonantly by BICs can be switched on or off with high selectivity with respect to the fundamental pump polarization. This approach provides an effective tuning mechanism exploring the polarization degree of freedom for switchable nonlinear subwavelength sources of light."

Specifically, we discuss the recent studies of photon-pair generation in dielectric metasurfaces through the simplest nonlinear optical processes, being spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC), first observed in Ref. [137]. In SPDC, a pump photon splits into two daughter photons, called signal and idler. The emission of such a pair can be viewed similarly to the spontaneous emission of single photons: the pump photon excites the nonlinear system and then the two-photon spontaneous transition down brings the system back to the ground state. This transition, mediated by the second-order susceptibility, leads to the spontaneous emission of a photon pair. Like a single-photon transition, it requires the vacuum field for its explanation. Similarly, the enhancement of this vacuum field due to a resonance at one"

This was recently predicted theoretically [138,139] and realized experimentally using single nanoresonators [140], Mie-resonant metasurfaces [141,142], and metasurfaces with nonlocal resonances [143]. The first demonstration of Mie-resonant photon-pair generation via SPDC in all-dielectric metasurfaces used an array of truncated pyramids made from "

Two-, three-, and four-dimensional two-photon path entanglement was experimentally confirmed. Moreover, multiphoton state generation was also shown. The purity and indistinguishability of four- and six-photon produced by different metalenses were confirmed using Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. The metalens-array-based quantum photon source provides a route for the generation and control of complex quantum states and is promising for the development of compact integrated quantum devices."

We believe that in future works, nonlinear quantum metasurfaces will be used for non-classical light generation via SPDC and spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in a broad range of the spectrum, from UV to IR, with unique tunable properties of generated quantum states, such as entanglement, polarization, direction, orbital angular momentum, and wavelength."

Metasurfaces are two-dimensional planar structures that originate from the basic concepts of metamaterial physics. They introduce even broader possibilities via engineering arrays of optical resonators underpinning the emerging field of flat optics. As a result, metasurfaces do not require any phase-matching conditions, and their performance relies on the local enhancement of both electric and magnetic fields, so resonances play an essential role in the physics of nonlinear metasurfaces. Thus, nonlinear photonics of metasurfaces is driven in many cases by resonances in dielectric nanostructures: optically induced multipolar electric and magnetic Mie resonances, guided-mode resonances, and BICs. These resonances allow us to boost subwavelength confinement of local electromagnetic fields in dielectric nanostructures with high refractive index values, enhancing many effects in nonlinear photonics and offering novel opportunities for the subwavelength control of light at the nanoscale."

In particular, we have emphasized multi-frequency effects, cascaded harmonic generation, asymmetric frequency conversion, and the nonlinear chiral response of metasurfaces. Most of the effects reported for nonlinear metasurfaces highlight the importance of the optically induced magnetic response of engineering nonmagnetic resonant structures for many applications in optics. In addition, we have discussed nonperturbative nonlinear regimes, which might introduce new design strategies in the field of nonlinear metasurfaces, and applications of nonlinear metasurfaces to quantum photonics, underpinning efficient flat-optics quantum meta devices."

All-dielectric nanostructures are less lossy but show smaller values of nonlinear response, and their larger mode volumes due to the diffraction limit that increase the device footprints. Transparent oxides and two-dimensional materials have been successfully adopted as important materials to create hybrid metasurfaces [153]. For tunability, metasurface-based photonics needs to employ a combination of old and novel materials such as polymers, perovskites, TMDCs, and phase change materials [154]. This would enable diverse functionalities of metasystems and metasurfaces for efficient spatial and temporal control of light expanding applications of these concepts in nanolasers, tunable metadevices, metachemistry, and the design of a new generation of sensing devices."
