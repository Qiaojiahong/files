In this study, we summarize recent compelling insights into hallucinations in LLMs. We present a novel taxonomy of hallucinations from various text generation tasks, thus provide theoretical insights, detection methods and improvement approaches. Based on this, future research directions are proposed. Our contribution are threefold: (1) We provide a detailed and complete taxonomy for hallucinations appearing in text generation tasks; (2) We provide theoretical analyses of hallucinations in LLMs and provide existing detection and improvement methods; (3) We propose several research directions that can be developed in the future. As hallucinations garner significant attention from the community, we will maintain updates on relevant research progress<sup>1</sup>."

These models implicitly encode global knowledge within their parameters during the pre-training phase (Han et al., 2021; Huang and Chang, 2023), offering valuable insights as knowledge repositories for downstream tasks (Pu and Demberg, 2023; Kojima et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b).

While the privacy and timeliness of data in the real world (Lazaridou et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2023b) unfortunately exacerbate this problem, leaving models difficult to maintain a comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of the facts. These challenges present a serious obstacle to the reliability of LLMs, which we refer to as hallucination. (Yu et al., 2022). A prominent example of this drawback is that models typically generate statements that appear reasonable but are either cognitively irrelevant or factually incorrect. In light of this observation, hallucinations remain a critical challenge in medical (Dash et al., 2023; Umapathi et al., 2023), financial (Gill et al., 2023) and other knowledge-intensive fields due to the exacting accuracy requirements. Particularly, the applications for legal case drafting showcase plausible interpretation as an aggregation of diverse subjective perspectives (Curran et al., 2023)."

As depicted in Figure 1, hallucination refers to the generation of texts or responses that exhibit grammatical correctness, fluency, and authenticity, but deviate from the provided source inputs (faithfulness) or do not align with factual accuracy (factualness) (Ji et al., 2023). In traditional NLP tasks (Maynez et al., 2020), hallucinations are often synonymous with faithfulness: conflicting information leads to Intrinsic Hallucination, i.e., LMs conflict with the input information when generating a response; Conversely, generating ambiguous supplementary information may lead to Extrinsic Hallucination, i.e., LMs produce personal names, historical events, or technical documents that is challenging to verify. LLMs-oriented hallucinations instead prioritize factuality, focusing on whether the result can be evidenced or negated by reference to external facts in the real world. Uncritical trust in LLMs can give rise to a phenomenon Cognitive Mirage, contributing to misguided decision-making and a cascade of unintended consequences (Zhang et al., 2023a)."

(2023f) covers methods for effectively collecting high-quality instructions for LLM alignment, including the use of NLP benchmarks, human annotations, and leveraging strong LLMs. Pan et al. (2023) discusses self-correcting methods where LLM itself is prompted or guided to correct the hallucinations from its own outputs. Despite some benchmarks (Lin et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023b; Mihindukulasooriya et al., 2023) is constructed to evaluate whether LLMs"

Given the varying quality and range of knowledge within pre-trained corpus, the information incorporated into the LLMs may be incomplete or outdated. In cases where pertinent memories are unavailable, the LLM's performance may deteriorates, resorting to rudimentary corpus-based heuristics that rely on term frequencies to render judgements (McKenna et al., 2023). Another bias stems from the capacity for contextual learning (Chan et al., 2022) when a few demonstrations are introduced as input to the prefix context.

Even when considering the automatic updating of textual knowledge bases, the output can deviate from the expected corrections (Huang et al., 2023). For example, questions often do not align effectively with stored knowledge, and the available information remains unknown until the questions are presented. This knowledge gap poses thorny challenges in balancing memory with retrieved evidence, which is construed as a passive defense mechanism against the misuse of retrieval (Gao et al., 2023a). To in-depth analyses this issue, Zhang et al. (2023b) and Halawi et al. (2023) propose that disregarding retrieved evidence introduces biased model knowledge, while mis-covering and over-thinking disrupt model behavior. Furthermore, in scenarios where a cache component is utilized to offer historical memory during training (Wan et al., 2023), the model also experiences inconsistency between the present hidden state and the hidden state stored in the cache."

Besides, sampling techniques characterized by high uncertainty (Lee et al., 2022), such as top- and top-k, exacerbate the issue of hallucination. Furthermore, Zhang et al.

Since perturbations (e.g., spellings or capital errors) can induce hallucinations reliably, traditional machine translation models tend to validate instances memorised by the model when subjected to perturbations (Bawden and Yvon, 2023; Hendy et al., 2023). It is worth noting that hallucinations generated by LLMs are mainly translation off-target, over-generation, or failed translation attempts (Guerreiro et al., 2023a). While in low-resource language setting, most models exhibit subpar performance due to the lack of annotated data (Dale et al., 2023). In contrast, they are vulnerable to increased amount of pre-trained languages in multilingual setting (Conneau et al., 2020). Subsequently, familial LLMs trained on different scales of monolingual data are proved to be viscous (Guerreiro et al., 2023a), as the source of oscillatory hallucination pathology."

For example, LLMs are mostly unable to avoid answering when provided with no relevant information, instead provide incomplete and plausible answers (Adlakha et al., 2023). In addition to external knowledge, memorized information without accurate, reliable and accessible source also contributes to different types of hallucinations (Umapathi et al., 2023). Though scaling laws suggest that perplexity on the training distribution is positively correlated with parameter size, (Lin et al., 2022) further discovers that scaling up models should increase the rate of imitative falsehoods."

Automatically generated abstracts based on LLMs may be fluent, but they still typically lack faithfulness to the source document. Compared to the human evaluation of traditional summarization models (Maynez et al., 2020), the summarizations generated by LLMs can be categorized into two major types: intrinsic hallucinations that distort the information present in the document; extrinsic hallucinations that provide additional information that cannot be directly attributed to the document (Qiu et al., 2023). Note that extrinsic hallucination as a metrics of factually consistent continuation of inputs in LLMs is given more attention in summarisation systems (Tam et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023). Furthermore, Cao et al. (2022) subdivides extrinsic hallucinations into factual and non-factual hallucinations. The former provides additional world knowledge, which may benefit comprehensive understanding."

To address this, Yu et al. (2023a) establish a distinction between correctly generated knowledge and knowledge hallucinations in terms of knowledge creation. Notably, the Virtual Knowledge Extraction (Zhu et al., 2023d) underscores the potential generalization capabilities of LLMs in the realms of constructing and inferring from knowledge graphs. Mihindukulasooriya et al. (2023) further empower LLMs to produce interpretable fact-checks through a neural symbolic approach. Based on their fidelity to the source, hallucinations are defined as subject hallucination, relation hallucination, and object hallucination."

These metrics focus on measuring faithfulness of references and fail to provide an assessment of factualness. Despite some reference-free works are proposed, plugin-based methods (Dong et al., 2022) suffer from world knowledge limitation. QA-based matching metrics (Durmus et al., 2020) lack knowledge completeness of source information. NLI-based methods (Dziri et al., 2022c) are unable to support finer-grained hallucination checking as they are sentence-level, besides entailment and hallucination problems are not equivalent. As the paradigm shift in hallucination detection arising from the rapid development of LLMs, we present a novel taxonomy in Fig 3 and introduce each category in following sections."

Some other studies (Li et al., 2023b) found that adding chains of thought precede output may intervene in the final judgement, whereas retrieving the knowledge properly resulted in gains. Furthering this concept, the hinted classifier and explainer (Shen et al., 2023), used to generate intermediate process labels and high-quality natural language explanations, were demonstrated to enhance the final predicted class from a variety of perspectives. Subsequently, Tam et al. (2023) suggests adopting a different classifier model to the generated model, contributing to easier judgement of factual consistency. For radiology report generation, binary classifiers (Mahmood et al., 2023) can be leveraged to measure the reliability by combining image and text embedding."

It is important to examine the correlation between the hallucination metric and the quality of output from a variety of perspectives. One intuitive approach is to employ the probabilistic output of the model itself, as ASTSN (Varshney et al., 2023) calculates the models' uncertainty about the identified concepts by utilising the logit output values. Similarly, BARTSCORE (Yuan et al., 2021) employs a universal notion that models trained to convert generated text to reference output or source text will score higher when the generated text is superior. It is an unsupervised metric that supports the addition of appropriate prompts to improve the measure design, without human judgement to train. Furthermore, KoK (Amayuelas et al., 2023) based on the work of Pei and Jurgens (2021) evaluates answer uncertainty from three categories, i.e., subjectivity, hedges and text uncertainty.

The motivating idea of SelfCheckGPT (Manakul et al., 2023) is to use the ability of the LLMs themselves to sample multiple responses and identify fictitious statements by measuring the consistency of information among responses. Kadavath et al. (2022) further illustrates that both the increase in size and the demonstration of assessment can improve self-assessment. Beyond repetitive multiple direct queries, Agrawal et al. (2023) uses open-ended indirect queries and compares their answers to each other for an agreed-upon score outcome. Self-Contradictory (Mündler et al., 2023) imposes appropriate constraints on the same LLM to generate pairs of sentences triggering self-contradictions, which prompt the detection. In contrast, Polling-based querying (Li et al., 2023i) reduce the complexity of judgement by randomly sampling query objects. Besides, Self-Checker (Li et al., 2023d) decomposes complex statements into multiple simple statements, fact-checking them one by one. However, Cohen et al.

Consequently, FActScore (Min et al., 2023) calculates the percentage of atomic facts supported by the given knowledge source. Towards adapting the tasks that users in interaction with generative models, FacTool (Chern et al., 2023) proposes to integrate a variety of tools into a task-agnostic and domain-agnostic detection framework, in order to assemble evidence about the authenticity of the generated content."

A cutting-edge strategy is to guide effective knowledge through parameter conditioning, editing, and optimisation. For example, CLR (Sun et al., 2023) optimises to reduce the generation probability of negative samples at span level utilising contrastive learning parameters. While introducing contextual knowledge background that contradicts the model's intrinsic prior knowledge, TYE (Shi et al., 2023a) effectively reduces the weight of prior knowledge through context-aware decoding method. Besides, PURR (Chen et al., 2023a) corrupts noise into the text, fine-tune compact editors, and denoise by merging relevant evidence. To introduce additional cache component, HISTALIGN (Wan et al., 2023) discovers that its hidden state is not aligned with the current hidden state, and proposes sequence information contrastive learning to improve the reliability of memory parameters.

Instead, TRAC (Li et al., 2023f) combines conformal prediction and global testing to augment retrieval-based QA.

A source of hallucination is that LLMs may leverage the patterns observed in the pre-training data for inference in a novel form. Recently, ORCA (Han and Tsvetkov, 2022) reveals problematic patterns in the behaviour of models by probing supporting data evidences from pre-training data. Similarly, TRAK (Park et al., 2023) and Data-Portraits (Marone and Durme, 2023) analyse whether models plagiarise or reference existing resources by means of data attribution. QUIP (Weller et al., 2023) further demonstrates that providing text that has been observed in the pre-training phase can improve the ability of LLMs to generate more factual information. Furthermore, motivated by the gap between LLMs and human modes of thinking, one intuition is to align the two modes of reasoning. Thus CoT (Wei et al., 2022b) elicits"

Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023) also employs verbal reinforcement to generate reflective feedback by learning about prior failings. Verify-and-Edit (Zhao et al., 2023a) proposes a CoT-prompted verify-and-edit framework, which improves the fidelity of predictions by post-editing the inference chain based on externally retrieved knowledge.

As an attempt to extend the language model for halocination mitigation, a suggestion is to retrieve relevant documents from large textual databases. RETRO (Borgeaud et al., 2022) splits the input sequence into chunks and retrieves similar documents, while In-Context RALM (Tam et al., 2023) places the selected document before the input text to improve the prediction. Furthermore, IRCOT (Trivedi et al., 2023) interweaves CoT generation and document retrieval steps to guide LLMs. Since scaling mainly improves the memory for common knowledge but does not significantly improve the memory for factual knowledge in the long tail, POPQA (Mallen et al., 2023) retrieves only non-parametric memories when necessary to improve performance. LLM-AUGENTER (Peng et al., 2023) also bases the responses of LLMs on integrated external knowledge and automated feedback to improve the truthfulness score of the answers. Another work, CoK (Li et al., 2023h) iteratively analyses future content of upcoming sentences, and then applies them as a query to retrieve relevant documents for the purposes of re-generating sentences when they contain low confidence tokens. Similarly, RETA-LLM (Liu et al., 2023c) creates a complete pipeline to assist users in building their own domain-based LLM retrieval systems. Note that in addition to document re"

As language models become more sophisticated, evaluation feedback can significantly improve the quality of generated text, as well as reduce the appearance of hallucinations. To realise this concept, LSHF (Stiennon et al., 2020) predicts human-preferred summarizations through model and employs this as the reward function to fine-tune the summarization strategy using reinforcement learning. However, this approach builds on models crafted by human annotators, which makes them inefficient in terms of data utilization. Therefore, TLM (Menick et al., 2022) proposes to improve the reliability of the system by selecting a few questions to refuse to answer, which significantly improves the reliability of the system, through reinforcement learning from human preferences. Whereas reinforcement learning often suffers from imperfect reward functions and relies on challenging optimisation. Thus, Chain-of-Hindsight (Liu et al., 2023a) converts feedback preferences into sentences, which are then fed into models with fine-tuning for enhanced language comprehension."

Note that automated error checking can also utilise LLMs to generate text that conforms to tool interfaces. PaD (Zhu et al., 2023c) distills the LLMs with a synthetic inference procedure, and the synthesis program obtained can be automatically compiled and executed by an explainer. Further, iterative refinement processes are validated to effectively identify appropriate details (Ning et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023b; Yu et al., 2023b), and can stop early invalid reasoning chains, beneficially reducing the phenomenon of hallucination snowballing (Zhang et al., 2023a)."

Before a final answer is presented, the resultant community of models can hold and maintain multiple reasoning chains and possible answers simultaneously. Based on this idea, MAD (Liang et al., 2023) adds a judge-managed debate process, demonstrating that adaptive interruptions of debate and controlled \"tit-for-tat\" states help to complete factual debates. Furthermore, FORD (Xiong et al., 2023) proposes roundtable debates that include more than two LLMs and emphasises that competent judges are essential to dominate the debate. LM-vs-LM (Cohen et al., 2023) also proposes multi-round interactions between LM and another LM to check the factualness of original statements. Besides, PRD (Li et al., 2023e) proposes a peer rank and discussionbased evaluation framework to arrive at a well-recognised assessment result that all peers are in agreement with. In an effort to maintain strong reasoning, SPP (Wang et al., 2023g) utilises LLMs to assign several fine-grained roles, which effectively stimulates knowledge acquisition and reduces hallucinations."

High quality data present promising opportunities for facilitating the reduction of hallucinations in LLMs (Kirstain et al., 2022). Inspired by the basic rule of machine learning models: \"Garbage input, garbage output\", Zhou et al. (2023) proposes the superficial alignment hypothesis, which views alignment as learning to interact with the user. The results of simple fine-tuning on a few high-quality samples demonstrate that data quality and diversity outweigh the importance of fine-tuning large-scale instructions (Mishra et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022) and RLHF (Bai et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022).

However, the main problem still remains in the deviation from the application requirements, which leads to emergence of diverse hallucinations. Thus, downstream task alignment especially built on vertical domain cognition necessitates expanded symbolic reasoning, decomposition and planning of complex tasks, and faithful external knowledge injection. Specifically, while expert in language processing, LLMs struggle to make breakthroughs in mathematical abilities, a deficiency attributable to the textual training objective. Though some researches for symbolic math word problems (Gaur and Saunshi, 2023; Zhu et al., 2023b) have been proposed, enhancing symbolic reasoning and answering numerical questions remains to be explored extensively. Additionally, for story generation tasks that demand diverse outputs (Yang et al., 2022, 2023), fascinating storylines are required in addition to avoiding factual contradictions. Therefore, achieving a balance between faithfulness and creativity in the model inference process remains a crucial challenge. Moreover, integrating new knowledge to deal with knowledge-intensive tasks involves handling joint reasoning between the implicit knowledge of LLMs and the explicit knowledge of external knowledge graphs. There arises a challenge to design knowledge-aware methods to incorporate structured information from the knowledge graph into the pre-training process of LLMs. Alternatively, the reasoning process is expected to be dynamically injected with knowledge graph information (Wen et al., 2023)."

The emerging CoT technique (Wei et al., 2022b) stimulates the emergent reasoning ability of LLMs by imitating intrinsic stream of thought. Constructing a logically intermediate reasoning step has been proved to significantly improve the problem-solving ability. Recently, A primary improvement is Self-consistency with CoT (CoT-SC) (Yao et al., 2023), which is a method for generating multiple CoT options and then selecting the optimal result as feedback. Further, Tree of Thoughts (ToT) (Yao et al., 2023) introduces a strict tree architecture into the thought process, which facilitates the development with different paths of thought and provides a novel roll-back function. Since previous methods have no storages for intermediate results, Cumulative Reasoning (CR) (Zhang et al., 2023c) uses LLMs in a cumulative and iterative manner to simulate human thought processes, and decompose the task into smaller components. However, the actual thinking process creates a complex network of ideas, as an example, people could explore a particular chain of reasoning, backtrack or start a new chain of reasoning. In particular when aware that an idea from a previous chain of reasoning can be combined with the currently explored idea, they could be merged into a new solution. More excitingly, Graph of Thoughts(GoT) (Zhang et al., 2023c) extends the dependencies between thoughts by constructing vertices with multiple incoming edges to aggregate arbitrary thoughts. In addition, Program-aided language models (PAL) (Gao et al., 2023b) and Program of Thoughts prompting (PoT) (Chen et al., 2022b) introduce programming logic into the language space (Bi et al., 2023), expanding the ability to invoke external explainers. As a summary, we believe that research based on human cognition helps to provide brilliant and insightful insights into the analysis of hallucinations, such as Dual Process Theory (Frankish, 2010), Three layer mental model (Stanovich, 2011), Computational Theory of Mind (Piccinini, 2004), and Connectionism (Thorndike, 1898)."

                                    "content": "reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Li et al. (2023i) confirms the severity of hallucinations in MLLM by object detecting and polling-based querying. The results indicate that the models are highly susceptible to object hallucination, and the generated description does not match the target image. Besides, Shao et al. (2023) that MLLMs have limited multimodal reasoning ability as well as dependence on spurious cues. Though current study (Yin et al., 2023b) provides a broad overview of MLLMs, the causation of hallucinations has not been comprehensively investigated. The hallucinations in LLMs come mainly from misknowledge in the training data, whereas the challenge of MLLMs lies in accurately relaying the abstract visual encoding into the semantic space. Existing MLLMs are fine-tuned with instructions to make their target outputs follow human intentions. However, misalignment between visual and textual modes may lead to biased distribution. Further, the lack of visual constraints results in a serious problem of hallucination in MLLMs. Thus a potential improvement is to penalise deviating attention to images (Wang et al., 2023a) or to enhance understanding of visual common sense. In terms of fine-grained visual and textual modal alignment, focusing on local features of images and corresponding textual descriptions can provide faithful modal interactions. In addition, the performance of some MLLMs such as MiniGPT-4 (Zhu et al., 2023a) is highly dependent on the choice of prompts and requires careful selection. Note that a controlled trade-off between diversity and hallucinations is needed for user convenience. In the future, as more sophisticated multi-model applications emerge, improving MLLMs reasoning paths is also a promising research direction."
