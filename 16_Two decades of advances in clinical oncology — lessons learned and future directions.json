However, over the past two decades, all major stakeholders in oncology, including clinicians, researchers and drug developers, have understood that cancer only develops when immunosurveillance fails. Thus, to strive, neoplastic cells must 'trick out' immune cells or develop in a context in which the immune system is already affected by hereditary or acquired defects. This notion has deeply affected biomarker discovery, which is now dominated by the search for determinants of cancer immunogenicity and deep immunophenotyping of tumour-infiltrating leukocytes. In addition, mechanistic insights on immunosurveillance have led to the development of an expanding"

Jain: Despite the importance of the tumour microenvironment (TME) – the 'soil', as defined by Steven Paget in 1889 – in cancer progression, oncology research has been largely focused on cancer cells – the 'seed'. The past 20 years have witnessed major advances in our understanding of the TME and the mechanisms by which it mediates tumour progression and resistance to treatment. A major example of such an advance is the reprogramming of the immune TME using immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), a discovery that has revolutionized the treatment of multiple solid tumour types and was recognized with the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to James Allison and Tasuko Honjo. Another advance is the recognition and translation of the counterintuitive concept that vascular normalization using anti-angiogenic agents (which were originally developed to kill tumour vessels) to mitigate deleterious aspects of the TME can improve the response of solid tumours to radiation, cytotoxic agents and/or ICIs<sup>2</sup>. As a result, vascular-normalizing drugs targeting the VEGF-VEGFR pathway, alone and combined, are now part of FDA-approved treatment regimens for many solid tumour types<sup>3</sup>. Finally, mathematical modelling and machine learning approaches are providing deeper mechanistic insights, aiding drug discovery and design, and being tested for cancer detection and diagnosis."

These cellular products were approved by the FDA in 2017, first for paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, based on the results from remarkably small trials owing to the extremely high efficacy in patients with refractory disease[9,10]. In addition to the fact that approvals for paediatric patients preceded those for adults, other notable aspects of these regulatory decisions include the similar objective response rates across multiple trials testing different versions of the CD19 CAR construct, the fact that this was the first gene therapy approval and the ability for the pharmaceutical industry in collaboration with regulators to develop manufacturing infrastructure for the routine generation of patient-specific treatments. These approvals also set the clinical and regulatory foundation for the field of cell and gene therapy in cancer more broadly. The success of CD19-targeted CAR T cells was followed by a rapid proliferation of preclinical and clinical studies that resulted in the approval of B cell maturation antigen-targeting CAR T cells for patients with multiple myeloma."

Diagnosis often occurs after symptoms appear, despite the availability of blood biomarkers for early detection (such as measurement of monoclonal proteins in blood). Patients with high-risk cytogenetic features often have disease resistant to treatment, including immunotherapies. Individuals from ethnic minorities, particularly Black individuals, face disparities in myeloma care, including delayed diagnosis and limited access to novel therapies and clinical trials, leading to inferior survival relative to white individuals. Access to costly treatments is also unequal globally. Finally, prolonged treatment with multidrug regimens can lead to severe toxicities, reducing quality of life (QOL)."

The reality that multiple targeted therapies for 11 distinct classes of oncogenic alterations have been approved is astounding progress. Iterative drug design improved on early-generation tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs), resulting in more-selective and central nervous system-penetrant next-generation TKIs that abrogated kinase-intrinsic resistance. Such next-generation agents not only provide opportunities for sequential targeted therapy but also replaced early-generation TKIs as frontline treatments for patients with metastatic NSCLC. Novel approved therapies have also diversified mechanistically and moved beyond TKI monotherapy to include GTPase inhibitors, bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), and combinations of targeted agents and chemotherapy. Finally, adjuvant therapy with targeted agents has been approved for patients with non-metastatic oncogene-driven NSCLCs, marking a much-needed move into the treatment of earlier-stage disease."

However, understanding of the biology of each patient's disease has been limited; as a result, treatment decisions have largely focused on the androgen receptor or androgen receptor signalling axis followed by cytotoxic drugs. In the past decade, the increasing capability of tumour profiling has increased biology-guided treatment selection[20]. Examples include poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase"

However, all disease is only eliminated in a few of them, which can lead to the emergence of new disease entities owing to lineage plasticity, a transition from adenocarcinoma to a neuroendocrine phenotype consisting of markedly heterogeneous cell populations[21,22]. Most of these populations are not androgen receptor driven, lack androgen receptor or PSMA expression, and reside in individual sites of metastatic dissemination that are biologically diverse to the point of needing to be considered and approached therapeutically as 'individual patients'. Patients with this neuroendocrine subtype have typically received platinum-based therapies and have no SOC treatment options available because their disease cannot be considered as a single entity."

Molecular biomarkers are now essential to assigning lesions to distinct tumour entities, and profiling the DNA methylome has become a powerful tool that aids in brain tumour classification. In parallel, the tools used for neuroimaging of brain tumours have evolved with the addition of multiple new MRI and PET techniques, with focus on predicting the biological behaviour of tumours – notably their response to therapy. Artificial intelligence is beginning to be introduced for the imaging assessment of primary brain tumours."

First, we have seen a massive expansion in understanding of the underlying genetic make-up of paediatric cancers, with the discovery of hundreds of genetic alterations[32]. These distinctive molecular profiles are often not shared with adult cancers or can involve the same genes but affect different pathways or dependencies. This knowledge has enabled further definition of risk groups for treatment stratification and identification of a few predictive biomarkers for a limited number of targeted therapies. Compared with cancers in adults, paediatric cancers generally have a lower tumour mutational burden but share the phenomenon of somatic heterogeneity"

The limitations of current efforts to incentivize industry to make novel targeted drugs developed for adult patients available to paediatric patients with the same genetic alterations have emphasized the need for a mechanism-of-action-based approach to drug development. Many targets are unique to paediatric cancers and involve signalling pathways controlling developmental processes, which have not yet been translated into targeted therapies. The creation of the ACCELERATE Platform has started to address these challenges[33]. Of note, in some instances, such as the development of CAR T cell therapies, paediatric advances in academia have transformed therapeutic options for some refractory leukaemias ahead of their use in adults."

Liquid biopsy is a new diagnostic concept developed in the past two decades that enables obtaining tumour-specific information in patients from whom tumour tissue cannot be obtained or is difficult to obtain safely. Needle biopsies are invasive procedures and some locations are not easy to access, which limits the use of this gold standard in cancer diagnostics. By contrast, drawing blood is a minimally invasive procedure and blood is a pool of tumour cells or other analytes released from all possible locations (albeit with different shedding rates). Over the past 10 years, ctDNA has received enormous attention as a liquid biopsy-based biomarker, while research on circulating tumour cells has opened new avenues for a better understanding of tumour biology in patients with cancer, including intrapatent heterogeneity"

Although most of the care and research at that time was focused on patients with cancer, these programmes were developed outside of major cancer centres and universities. For decades, patients with cancer accessed palliative care only after disease progression on treatment, usually in the last days of life[38]. During the 1990s, a few academic palliative care centres recognized the need to support patients much earlier in their disease trajectory. This approach involved moving care to"

Booth: In the past two decades, some of the most important work in outcomes research has been related to defining the concept of 'value' in cancer care. Value represents the interface between benefit (the numerator) and cost (the denominator). By the mid-2000s, growing attention was placed on the rapidly rising price of oncology medicines (denominator). The lack of sustainability of these expenditures remains highly relevant in 2024 and presents major barriers to delivering high-quality and equitable care[41]."

These end points were initially considered as potential accurate predictors of gains in OS (or surrogates); however, we have since learned that true surrogacy exists in only a limited number of clinical circumstances. In addition, the fact that measurement of these end points is vulnerable to informative censoring and other forms of bias is increasingly recognized. Although some novel anticancer medicines offer very large improvements in outcome (with major gains in OS), aggregate data reveal that median gains in PFS or OS in RCTs are modest, typically 2-3 months. By virtue of the efficacy-effectiveness gap, these gains are even smaller in routine practice. These limitations in contemporary medical oncology have tremendous relevance to patients who live with the clinical toxicity,"

Nevertheless, I argue that the most important mission of the immune system is the maintenance of tissue homeostasis, which is achieved by eliminating infectious pathogens (and often infected cells) as well as damaged or senescent cells in the context of 'sterile inflammation'. Simultaneously, the immune system must avoid potentially harmful reactions against autoantigens, food-derived antigens and commensal microorganisms. This concept implies that several hitherto unsuspected external factors suppress anticancer immune responses. Thus, immunosurveillance is enfeebled by chronic autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, ageing, and intestinal dysbiosis, all of which can occur independently from each other or – more often – in a compounded form. In this context, identifying actionable targets that might be suppressed to re-establish cancer immunosurveillance is of major importance. Such targets could include pro-inflammatory factors and cells, metabolites and (neuro)endocrine factors involved in metabolic syndrome, and signalling pathways that accelerate ageing and harmful microorganisms. The future of oncology involves a broad, holistic vision of the cancer-immune system crosstalk"

A priority should be leveraging TME normalization and immunotherapies for pancreatic cancer, and primary or secondary brain tumours, for which effective therapies are still needed. The increased prevalence of obesity worldwide highlights the need for novel strategies to overcome the adverse consequences of this condition on the TME and response to treatment. Furthermore, leveraging insights into the role of physical forces (elevated interstitial fluid pressure and compressive forces), microbiota, cancer cell-neuron crosstalk, diet and physical activity in cancer progression and response to treatment could lead to new therapeutic"

Achieving this ambitious goal requires fundamental changes. First, we must deepen our understanding of disease biology, including the immune TME. To achieve cures, we must target and eradicate the earliest progenitor cells of multiple myeloma. Second, early intervention is crucial. We need to detect and treat multiple myeloma at its earliest stages, long before symptoms appear. By then, the disease has often evolved substantially, leading to treatment resistance. Third, multiple myeloma should be treated as a spectrum of multiple diseases requiring tailored treatments rather than a singular entity. Such an approach involves assessing genetic and immune biomarkers early on to personalize therapy and avoid ineffective treatments."

Mechanistic diversification will remain crucial as certain oncogenic alterations might only be actionable with agents from therapeutic classes other than small-molecule kinase or GTPase inhibitors (such as protein degraders or epigenome modifiers, with therapeutic relevance that remains to be substantiated). Approaches targeting the proteome will continue to be a focus of research. This year's tumour-agnostic approval of the ADC trastuzumab deruxtecan for HER2-positive cancers underscores the value of orthogonal cell-surface protein targeting that might bypass the limitations of small molecule-induced genomic complexity. For all of the above reasons, the development of clinical-grade comprehensive proteomic assays is an unmet need."

For patients potentially cured of breast cancer in particular, de-escalation of therapy is an emerging priority. The neoadjuvant period is already used to make treatment decisions when residual disease is detected[15-17] and can provide clues for individual tailoring of treatment beyond de-escalation. For example, many patients could already be cured with locoregional interventions only, and special effort should be made to identify such patients and spare them from useless additional treatment. Formal validation of pathological complete response as a surrogate of potential cure together with the already available validation of residual disease as a marker of resistance could shape new strategies based on response-adapted treatment and on markers of residual disease during and after neoadjuvant therapy as initial trials such as PHERGain are illustrating[51]."

Second, phase III trials in the advanced-stage setting are testing triplet regimens in which a third drug (such as an anti-TIGIT or anti-LAG3 antibody) is added to ICI-ICI, and ICI-anti-VEGF antibody or TKI combinations. Triplet regimens could enable a wider and deeper effect in patients who currently have disease control in response to doublet regimens. Similarly, personalized vaccines could further boost immune responses by activating T cells with novel neoantigens. Third, once these efforts reach a ceiling of clinical benefit or unacceptable toxicities, the development of biomarkers to maximize benefit from precision oncology should be prioritized. Nonetheless, one-third of patients with advanced-stage HCC still present with an aggressive phenotype that remains primarily resistant to ICIs owing to a strong immunosuppressive TME.

Depending on the location (pancreatic tail, body, head or uncinate process) and the individual cancer extension outside of the pancreas, different vascular, lymphatic and neural structures must be approached individually. Initial clinical trials applying a precise surgical approach to prevent local recurrence have shown that, with such a multimodal concept, better local cancer clearance leads to improved OS in patients with pancreatic cancer."

Based on these experiences, future advances will probably be driven by smaller but much better-designed clinical trials, including phase 0 clinical trials designed to verify target engagement, and focusing on biomarker-selected patient populations. Moreover, local therapies, including ACT with CAR T cells, might gain momentum because these approaches reduce systemic toxicity and glioblastoma remains a disease essentially restricted to the central nervous system. We have traditionally assumed that the lack of metastases from primary brain tumours could be related to superior immune control outside of, as opposed to within, the brain. The emerging field of cancer neuroscience, which has identified intricate interactions between brain parenchymal cells and brain cancer cells, provides another explanation of why the growth of these tumours is primarily local. Interventions targeting this potentially essential crosstalk between brain and cancer cells open up a new avenue for brain cancer-specific pharmacological interventions[55]."

The most pressing research priority in the next two decades is to perform mixed-methods research to better understand how patients perceive these complex cost-benefit trade-offs and how we can better deliver outcomes that matter[59]. Ultimately, the oncology clinical and research communities need to have frank discussions about where we can put our efforts to have the greatest impact on the lives of people who have cancer."
