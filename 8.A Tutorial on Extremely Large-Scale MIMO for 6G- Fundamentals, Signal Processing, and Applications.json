With its growing significance, both opportunities and challenges are concurrently manifesting. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of research on XL-MIMO wireless systems. In particular, we introduce four XL-MIMO hardware architectures: uniform linear array (ULA)-based XL-MIMO, uniform planar array (UPA)-based XL-MIMO utilizing either patch antennas or point antennas, and continuous aperture (CAP)-based XL-MIMO. We comprehensively analyze and discuss their characteristics and interrelationships. Following this, we introduce several electromagnetic characteristics and general distance boundaries in XL-MIMO. Given the distinct electromagnetic properties of near-field communications, we present a range of channel models to demonstrate the benefits of XL-MIMO. We further discuss and summarize signal processing schemes for XL-MIMO. It is worth noting that the low-complexity signal processing schemes and deep learning empowered signal processing schemes are reviewed and highlighted to promote the practical implementation of"

These new requirements have inspired novel application scenarios by extending conventional 5G eMBB, mMTC, and URLLC into their enhanced 6G counterparts: further eMBB, ultra-mMTC, and extensive variations of URLLC [9], [13]. Addressing these extremely high expected demands on 6G, several promising technologies are garnering substantial attention, such as extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) [14], [15], [16], reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], and Terahertz-band communications [22], [23], [24]. All these technologies are promising"

MIMO technology has been a key enabler of high-rate wireless communication since the fourth generation (4G) of wireless networks [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]. With the rapid development of wireless communications and more critical communication demands of users [31], the concept of mMIMO was proposed in [32]. Compared with basic MIMO technology, mMIMO involves much larger numbers of antennas (up to hundreds of antennas) at a wireless base station (BS). With the aid of many antennas, the so-called channel hardening phenomenon and the favorable propagation conditions can be exploited in mMIMO to reduce inter-cell interference and achieve better SE performance. MIMO systems can be divided into two implementation paradigms: centralized and distributed. As for the distributed implementation, the multicell scenario is a general case where distributed antennas are deployed among multiple serving cells. This concept includes coordinated multipoint (CoMP) [33], [34] and distributed antenna systems (DAS) [35], [36]. However, the concepts of cell and cell boundary still exist, and users at cell boundaries may suffer from strong inter-cell interference. To cope with this problem, a distributed mMIMO paradigm called cell-free massive MIMO (CF mMIMO) has been proposed in [37]. Compared with cellular mMIMO, the concept of cell boundary has been removed in CF mMIMO systems, where a large number of distributed access points (APs) are deployed in a wide area to serve the user equipment (UE) by joint transmission and reception [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44]. It is worth noting that, in this setting, all APs are connected to central processing units (CPUs), enabling various processing schemes with different levels of cooperation between the APs and CPUs to improve macro-diversity gain and achieve high SE performance uniformly within the coverage area. CF mMIMO is considered to be a key technology for beyond 5G and future wireless communications."

Thus, XL-MIMO stands as a critical facilitator for next-generation wireless networks, offering substantial improvements in spectral efficiency, spatial resolution, and degrees of freedom. These advancements, driven by its deployment of a large array of antennas and substantial array aperture, are essential to satisfying the increasing demands for high-capacity communications [14], [15], [16]. The basic idea of XL-MIMO is to deploy an extremely large number of antennas in a compact space. Two mainstream implementation approaches to this idea have been investigated in existing works. The first implementation approach is to deploy a huge number of antennas in a compact manner, where an antenna spacing much smaller than the widely used half-wavelength is applied.

The second implementation approach is to embed an approximately infinite number of antennas in a compact space in an extremely dense style so that the array aperture can be viewed as being approximately continuous with the aid of meta-materials. This approach is called continuous aperture (CAP) MIMO. An ideal CAP MIMO adopts the form of a spatially-continuous electromagnetic (EM) volume, where an infinite number of infinitesimal antennas are embedded. From a mathematical perspective, this implementation method can also be viewed as the case of the first approach with an infinitesimal antenna spacing. Note that the analytical modeling and practical implementation for the first realization approach are relatively mature. Thus, the first implementation approach has been widely considered in existing works. However, due to the compact deployment, the mutual coupling effect between the discrete antenna elements is severe. As for the second implementation approach, the emerging metamaterials can help to construct the approximately continuous aperture. However, only a few works have investigated the modeling and implementation of emerging meta-materials. Thus, the second approach needs to be further explored. Based on these two implementation approaches, many XL-MIMO designs with different architectures and terminologies have been studied, e.g., holographic MIMO [47], [51], [52], [53], large intelligent surfaces (LISs) [54], [55], [56], [57], extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) [15], [58], and CAP MIMO [59]. All these XL-MIMO designs are promising enablers for 6G and future wireless communications. However, the characteristics and mutual relationships among these designs have yet to be extensively discussed. Therefore, in this survey, we introduce all these promising XL-MIMO designs and present their features and their similarity and difference."

Besides, the extremely large number of antennas would lead to extremely high signal processing complexity and some other EM characteristics, such as the spatial non-stationarity and severe mutual coupling effect, which all need to be paid attention to when studying XL-MIMO systems."

The extremely large number of antennas results in significant signal processing complexity and unique EM characteristics not present in conventional mMIMO. With this increase in antennas, near-field communication traits become significant, making far-field-based channel models and signal processing schemes used in conventional mMIMO ineffective. Therefore, it is important to develop near-field channel models and signal processing schemes for XL-MIMO.

The physics aspects of HMIMOS were reviewed from the perspectives of hardware structures, holographic design methodologies, tuning mechanisms, and aperture shapes. Then, the theoretical foundations for HMIMO communications were comprehensively introduced from channel modeling, performance analysis, EM field sampling, and EM information theory inspired by a first-principles perspective. To promote the practical implementation of XL-MIMO, some signal processing schemes for HMIMO communications were reviewed regarding holographic channel estimation and holographic beamforming/beam focusing. However, the authors focus mainly on HMIMOS, which is one of the XL-MIMO technologies. Thus, a survey focusing on a more general XL-MIMO technology is needed. Also, theoretical foundations of the HMIMOS physical layer were reviewed in [16] briefly. Some critical issues for the practical implementation of XL-MIMO also need elaboration, such as the low-complexity signal processing schemes and practical implementation paradigm."

It emphasizes near-field beamfocusing and advanced antenna designs, detailing the hybrid beamforming architectures, metasurface-based antennas for approximating CAP antennas, DoF analysis framework for near-field communications, and near-field beam training. Additionally, the authors explored the performance analysis framework for line-of-sight (LoS) and statistical channels, respectively. For LoS channels, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and power scaling laws were studied. For the statistical channels, the authors analyzed the outage probability (OP), ergodic channel capacity (ECC), and ergodic mutual information (EMI). However, this study lacks a comparative analysis of XL-MIMO hardware design (so-called SPD antennas and CAP antennas in [70]), which calls for further research on low-complexity, near-field signal processing schemes."

The authors in [71] highlighted the near-field beam focusing aspect, where the spherical wave characteristics, near-field channel models, and promising near-field beam focusing features were presented. Alternatively, the technical problem \"What will be different between near-field communications and far-field communications?\" was addressed in [60] from four perspectives: channel modeling, performance analysis, beamforming, and applications.

The EM characteristics for XL-MIMO are first introduced in Section III-A, and distance boundaries are presented in Section III-B. More significantly, channel modeling for XL-MIMO is introduced from the perspective of LoS propagation channel modeling, NLoS channel propagation channel modeling, and"

For instance, ULA-based XL-MIMO systems in [83] and [66] were operated on the carrier frequency of 2.4 GHz and 3.5 GHz, respectively. Besides, in [74], the authors considered the operation frequency at a mmWave band with the carrier frequency of 30 GHz.

However, it is also more difficult for analysis since many integrals across each patch antenna element need to be calculated due to the consideration of element size. Although the sizeless antenna choice is easy to analyze, this choice is an idealistic assumption without considering element size, which may not be practical. The element architecture for UPA-based XL-MIMO can be selected based on different requirements. The sizeless antenna modeling and analysis ideas can also be implemented for the patch antenna-based scenario by assuming that only one receiving point across each antenna element is impinged. The system implementation features and antenna characteristics for UPA-based XL-MIMO are summarized in Table VI. Some main issues are clarified as follows:"

For 1D CAP-based XL-MIMO, line segments with continuous aperture can be considered [52], [120], [123], [130]. For 2D CAP-based XL-MIMO, 2D planes with arbitrary shapes are commonly adopted [47], [55], [57], [59], [125], [128], [131]. Among these works, the rectangular or square CAP planes have been widely considered [47], [54], [57], [59], [125], [128], [131]. For instance, the authors in [57] studied a general scenario of rectangular receiver planes with various length-width ratios. Besides, the circular CAP plane can be adopted [55], [131]. From a mathematical perspective, the 1D CAP line segment can be regarded as a special case of ULA-based XL-MIMO with infinitesimal antenna spacing. Similarly, the 2D CAP plane can also be regarded as a special case of UPA-based XL-MIMO with infinitesimal antenna spacing. Thus, CAP-based XL-MIMO analysis can be"

To maintain comparability, specific characteristics and settings across all designs must be uniform for fairness. For ULA-based XL-MIMO and 1D CAP line segment-based XL-MIMO, the performance comparison should be carried out with the same array aperture, i.e., the same array length. When comparing UPA-based XL-MIMO with 2D CAP plane-based XL-MIMO, due to the abundant geometric variables, several comparison principles could be considered: 1) Same side length: in this case, both the UPA and 2D CAP plane have the same physical size (i.e., side length, plane area, and array aperture); 2) Same plane area: for the fixed same plane area, the side length and the array aperture for the UPA and 2D CAP plane can be different; and 3) Same array aperture: the array aperture plays an important role in near-field communications. As such, the array aperture can also be a comparison criterion. Under Criteria 2) and 3), the side length and plane array can be adjusted to gain insights for the practical implementation of XL-MIMO.

For ULA-based XL-MIMO, thousands of antennas are employed. For UPA-based XL-MIMO, the number of antennas can even approach tens of thousands as many antennas can be simultaneously deployed across the vertical and horizontal directions. However, as studied in [14], [68], with the fixed physical size, there exists the EDoF performance saturation: the EDoF would increase and then become flat with the number of antennas increasing. Thus, it will be interesting to study the optimal number of antennas for different applications. For CAP-based XL-MIMO, thanks to the meta-material, continuous or approximately continuous array aperture can be realized by deploying extremely dense antennas in a compact space. Thus, an infinite number of infinitesimal antennas can be considered in an ideal CAP-based XL-MIMO. However, due to the extremely large number of antennas, the design complexity and deployed technology for XL-MIMO impose much higher requirements than that of conventional mMIMO."

For UPA-based XL-MIMO, many works consider that the antenna spacing is much smaller than the half-wavelength. More interestingly, UPA-based XL-MIMO can have different antenna spacing in the vertical direction and the horizontal direction instead of limiting them to equal, which provides various design flexibility for the practical implementation of XL-MIMO. Meanwhile, the infinitesimal or approximately infinitesimal antenna spacing can be realized for CAP-based XL-MIMO. Note that the much smaller antenna spacing, compared with that of conventional mMIMO, can provide the ability to deploy an extremely large number of antennas in a compact space with a fixed physical size. However, the small antenna spacing can introduce severe mutual coupling effects and increase the design precision, which should be noticed in XL-MIMO."

Due to the discrete aperture, the aperture size of these two XL-MIMO schemes is determined by the number of antennas and the antenna spacing. Moreover, the antenna spacing is usually dependent on the carrier frequency. Thus, the high carrier frequency and small antenna spacing are advocated to derive the moderate aperture size for implementing ULA-based XL-MIMO and UPA-based XL-MIMO. For CAP-based XL-MIMO, the aperture size can be precisely determined by the aperture length for 1D CAP-based XL-MIMO and the area or side length for 2D CAP-based XL-MIMO, respectively. Compared with mMIMO, the aperture size for XL-MIMO is much larger, which can be more clearly observed from Table V~Table VII."

When studying the signal processing and system optimization for these XL-MIMO designs, different analysis frameworks should be considered due to the different characteristics. For UPA-based XL-MIMO with patch antennas, from the perspective of the whole array, the analysis is performed in a discrete fashion due to the discrete features of each antenna element. However, from the perspective of each antenna element, an accurate analysis scheme is to capture the EM wave characteristics across each patch antenna element with a certain physical size. Thus, the analysis framework for each antenna element should be performed through exact integrals across each patch antenna element, such as the computation of channel gain for each antenna element [48], [94]. Besides, one simplified analysis framework for UPA-based XL-MIMO with patch antennas can be carried out by assuming that only one point across the antenna element is impinged by EM waves [14], [102]. Under this assumption, UPA-based XL-MIMO with patch antennas reduces to UPA-based XL-MIMO with point antennas. More interestingly, for CAP-based XL-MIMO, due to the continuous array aperture, the analysis should be performed based on the integral across the whole array. However, when performing the analysis, these XL-MIMO hardware designs can be mutually linked to each other as illustrated in Fig. 2."

Note that the EM region can be generally divided into far-field and near-field regions, bounded by the Rayleigh distance [136]. The EM wave characteristics for the nearfield and far-field are depicted in Fig. 3. The array aperture and the carrier frequency determine the Rayleigh distance, which will be introduced later in Section III-B. In conventional mMIMO, the Rayleigh distance can be neglected, due to the moderate array aperture, so the receivers are usually assumed to be located in the far-field region. In the far-field region, the EM wave can be simply modeled based on the plane wave assumption [14], [15], [16]. All antenna elements in the array for the plane wave embrace the same signal amplitude and angle of arrival/departure (AoA/AoD). Thus, in the farfield based on the plane-wave characteristics, only the angle characteristic can be relied on to perform the signal processing and system design."

More specifically, the EM wave in XL-MIMO should be modeled with the vectorial spherical wave characteristics [15], [45], [71].

However, in XL-MIMO, the extremely large array aperture would result in the spatial non-wide sense stationary properties [46], [63], [64], [66], [76], [77], [91]. When the array aperture is extremely large, different regions of the array would observe the propagation environment in different views, which means that the regions can observe the signal transmitted from a certain propagation path but with different powers or the signal transmitted from different propagation paths. Different terminals can be viewed by different regions of the array, and each terminal's power is focused on a particular region of the array. This particular visible region of the array from a given terminal is defined as the visibility region (VR) of this given terminal [46], [77], [137], [138]. The spatial stationary mMIMO and spatial non-stationary XL-MIMO diagram are shown in Fig. 4. For conventional mMIMO, as shown in Fig. 4 (a), all array elements are visible to the terminals, and the terminal's power can spread over the whole array. Thus, the channel for conventional mMIMO shows the stationary spatial property. For XL-MIMO, as shown in Fig. 4 (b), it can be found that the clusters are not visible over the whole array, and the power of each terminal is predominately focused on a limited region of the array, i.e., VRs.

It is worth noting that the channel for a particular terminal is assumed to be approximately stationary in its VRs and zero outside the VRs. To derive an analyzable structure, a simple choice is to decompose the array into a few sub-arrays, where each sub-array is visible to particular terminals. For this sub-array scheme, 1 and 0 vectors indicate whether a particular sub-array is the VR for a given terminal. This approach is adopted in [64], [76], [77], [140], [141] to make the spatial non-stationarity-aided XL-MIMO systems more tractable, which facilitates channel modeling and performance analysis for XL-MIMO."

Most works for conventional mMIMO omitted this EM polarization property for simplicity. However, it is necessary to consider this property since it can capture the actual EM characteristics in XL-MIMO [142], [143], [144]. Several studies have investigated the EM polarization property. In [144], [145], [146], [147], dual-polarization was analyzed. More specifically, the authors in [144] and [145] considered the dual-polarized UPA with square patch antennas. In [146], the dual-circularly polarized circular metasurface with various printed elements was studied. The authors in [147] considered the dual linear polarization based on the metasurface, where slot-shaped sub-wavelength unit cells were located across the metasurface. Moreover, the triple polarization was studied in [52], [57], [59], [68], [101], [120], modeled by the dyadic Green's function. The authors in [57] and [59] considered the tri-polarized 2D CAP plane. The tri-polarized 1D CAP line segment was investigated in [52] and [120]. Moreover, the authors in [68] and [101] studied the UPA with point antennas over the triple polarization. As observed in [68], the consideration of multiple polarizations benefited the EDoF performance compared with that of the single polarization."

The mutual coupling property denotes that the voltage on each antenna element would depend not only on the incident field but also on the voltages on other antenna elements [67]. This property becomes significant in a scenario with small antenna spacing. The mutual coupling property will deteriorate the channel and substantially degrade the signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) and the convergence of processing algorithms. Most existing works on XL-MIMO and mMIMO omitted the mutual coupling property. However, studies considered the mutual coupling property [56], [105], [149], [150]. The authors in [56] and [149] described the mutual coupling property with the aid of the mutual coupling matrix and investigated the effects of the mutual coupling property on the array gain and channel characteristics. Moreover, the authors in [150] investigated the effects of the mutual coupling property in the scenario with fixed physical spaces.

These characteristics are usually omitted in conventional mMIMO for ease of analysis. However, for XL-MIMO, these characteristics have been proven to be vital for accurate modeling and analysis. Thus, four electromagnetic characteristics have been thoroughly reviewed, which can embrace vital insights for the modeling and design of XL-MIMO systems with these characteristics considered."

It is also reasonable and tractable to use the classical Rayleigh distance to distinguish the near-field region with spherical wave characteristics and the far-field region with planar wave characteristics due to the small region of the reactive region and its uncommon evanescent wave characteristics."

The whole array was divided into multiple sub-arrays with a small number of antennas each. Furthermore, the UE can be regarded as located in the far-field region from the view of each sub-array, even if the UE is located in the near-field region of the whole array. Based on this assumption, the piecewise-far-field channel model was proposed to approximate the near-field channel. Then, a new metric called the normalized coherence was defined, determined by the near-field channel and its corresponding far-field approximation, which could directly influence the transmission rate. Correspondingly, the authors defined the effective Rayleigh distance "

It is worth noting that the first two distance boundaries, i.e., Rayleigh distance and Fresnel distance, are shown to be applicable to arbitrary array aperture for both the BS and UE. However, the last three distance boundaries, i.e., Björnson distance, effective Rayleigh distance, and critical distance were proposed based on particular scenarios, such as the scenario with a ULA-based BS and a single-antenna UE in [58] and [83]. Thus, the derivations for these three distance boundaries based on the generalized scenario with the arbitrary array aperture at the BS and the UE remain an open problem."

All these boundaries can give the researchers useful perspectives for the design and analysis of XL-MIMO and can be correspondingly chosen to model the EM characteristics for XL-MIMO. Besides, to promote further research on XL-MIMO, other distance boundaries can also be proposed to describe the EM characteristics for XL-MIMO systems better. The introduction of these distance boundaries can be motivated by the distance boundaries reviewed in this part."

Besides, the receivers for XL-MIMO are likely located in the near-field region. Thus, it is necessary to consider the LoS propagation channel model capturing the near-field EM characteristics introduced above."

The primary motivation of the Green's function based channel modeling scheme is to numerically solve Maxwell's equations, which can depict the electric field between each transmitting and receiving point. As for the complex-valued channel response representation scheme, the complex-valued channel response between each transmitting and receiving point is constructed, composed of the amplitude and phase components. These two LoS propagation channel modeling schemes can provide significant channel models for the analysis of XL-MIMO."

For the dyadic Green's function based channel modeling, the authors in [68] and [101] investigated UPA-based XL-MIMO with point antennas and patch antennas, respectively. The dyadic Green's function based channel for 2D CAP plane-based XL-MIMO was studied in [57] and [59], where both the transmitter and the receiver were equipped with a 2D CAP plane. Moreover, the authors in [52] and [120] considered 1D CAP line segment-based XL-MIMO. A practical case with unparallel 1D CAP line segments with arbitrary orientation and position was studied. Besides, the authors in [126] and [153] considered both ULA-based XL-MIMO and 1D CAP line segment-based XL-MIMO. The authors in [126] modeled and analyzed the system from the perspective of the asymptotic analysis,"

Moreover, 1D CAP line segment-based XL-MIMO was investigated, where unparallel 1D CAP line segments with arbitrary orientation and position were studied in [123]. This Green's function based channel modeling scheme is motivated by the actual propagation of EM waves and can capture the actual EM characteristics, which is advocated by many studies for the channel modeling of XL-MIMO."

Since the propagation distance is much larger than the array aperture, both amplitude and phase variations across the receiving aperture can be negligible. Furthermore, the channel response can be modeled based on the planar wave assumption, where all antenna elements experience the same signal amplitude and AoA/AoD. The amplitude component depends only on the propagation distance between the center of the receiver and the center of the transmitter, and the incident angle determines the phase variation."

Another choice for the amplitude component is to consider only the well-known free-space pathloss, which is determined by the propagation distance and the wavelength. The authors in [58] and [89] studied the amplitude component for the scenario with one BS equipped with ULA-based XL-MIMO and one single-antenna UE based on the free-space path loss. Furthermore, a piecewise-far-field model with piecewise-linear phase characteristics was proposed in [58] to approximate the near-field channel with high accuracy as shown in [58, Fig. 3]. This approximation was considered as a piecewise-linearization of the classical near-field channel model. The authors in [95] and [102] considered the scenario with one BS equipped with UPA-based XL-MIMO with patch antennas and multiple UEs equipped with multiple and single antennas, respectively. Due to the far smaller size of each patch antenna element than the propagation distance between each element and the UE, the propagation distance was assumed to be constant across each patch antenna element. Thus, the area of each patch antenna element was introduced when depicting the amplitude component as [102, eq. (10)] and [95, eq. (12)]."

As for the Green function based modeling scheme, which is available for both the discrete and continuous aperture, the diagram and characteristics are illustrated in Fig. 6 and Table IX. For the complex-valued channel response representation scheme, which is available for the discrete aperture, three general modeling schemes are reviewed: generalized gain based modeling, free-space pathloss based modeling, and reference power based modeling, which can be considered based on different criteria and requirements. Note that the Green function based modeling scheme can capture the essential EM characteristics, and the complex-valued channel response representation scheme is more tractable and easier to analyze. The relationship between these two modeling schemes is inspired in Fig. 7. Note that the Green's function based modeling scheme can accurately capture the EM wave characteristics."

When modeling the NLoS propagation channel, the complex scattered propagation environments and the near-field characteristics should be considered. Besides, as discussed above, the spatial nonstationarity should also be investigated since different regions of the array can experience different propagation parameters and environments when the array dimension is extremely large."

Firstly, the 2D Fourier plane-wave representation can represent the incident field based on the Weyl's identity [159].

The authors in [53] extended the scenario in [47] and [154] for the single UE to the scenario, where the BS and multiple UEs were all equipped with UPA-based XL-MIMO with patch antennas. It was found that the number of antennas per plane should be larger than the number of sampling lattice ellipses to fully guarantee to capture the EM characteristics. Moreover, based on [47] and [53], the Fourier plane-wave representation based channel modeling for the scenario with multiple BSs and UEs was investigated in [160] by assuming that the random characteristics for each BS-UE path were independent. Besides, the authors in [161] proposed an EM-compliant channel model based on the Fourier planewave series expansion based model in [47], where angular power spectrum, the distortion of antenna patterns, and the decrease of antenna efficiency were jointly investigated to"

In this modeling method, the NLoS channel response is denoted by the superposition of a particular number of array response vectors or the array response matrices determined by the array response vectors [69], [78], [88], [93], [117], [118], [130]. For convenience, we discuss the scenario where the transmitter and the receiver are equipped with ULA-based XL-MIMO. In this scenario, the NLoS channel comprises several array response matrices. Each array response matrix is determined by the complex NLoS path gain, the array response vector at the transmitter, and the array response vector at the receiver, as illustrated in Fig. 9. In the near-field, the array response vector is determined by both the AoA/AoD and the distance, which can model the spherical wave characteristics. However, in the far-field, the array response vector is only determined by the AoA/AoD rather than the distance."

The double-side near-field channel model was accordingly defined. Moreover, the authors in [117] and [118] modeled the NLoS channel based on the far-field array response vector representation."

For this modeling scheme, the LoS propagation component is modeled in the complex-valued response form, and the array response vector representation based modeling scheme depicts the NLoS propagation component with a particular number of scattering paths. Thus, the hybrid propagation path channel based on the complex-valued channel response modeling scheme can be derived by combining the above two components [78]. For the scenario where both the BS and the UE were equipped with ULA-based XL-MIMO in [78], the authors firstly modeled the LoS propagation component as the complex-valued response form as [78, eq. (25)]. Furthermore, the NLoS propagation component could also be modeled in the array response vector representation as [78, eq. (21)]. Thus, the hybrid propagation path channel was derived as [78, eq. (27)]. To explain the hybrid propagation path channel modeling based on the complex-valued channel response representation, we provide a tutorial as Algorithm 1."

As studied in [154], the LoS propagation channel could be firstly derived based on the scalar Green's function through [154, eq. (5)]. Then, the scalar Green's function based channel could be exactly given by the 2D Fourier plane-wave representation based on the Weyl's identity as [154, Lemma 1]. Moreover, the NLoS propagation could also be derived based on the 4D Fourier plane-wave representation as [154, Th. 1], which had also been discussed above in detail. Thus, the hybrid propagation channel can be derived by combining these two components in a unified manner. To better demonstrate this modeling scheme, a tutorial, describing the hybrid propagation path channel modeling based on the Fourier plane-wave representation method, is given in Algorithm 2."

The authors in [74], [163] investigated the hybrid-field channel model, where the BS was equipped with ULA-based XL-MIMO, and the UE was equipped with a single antenna. Here, the NLoS channel was modeled based on the array response vector representation based modeling in [69], where both the scatters located in the near-field and the scatters located in the far-field were considered. More specifically, the channel components contributed by the scatters located in the near-field and those contributed by the other scatters were modeled separately based on the array response vector representation for the near and far fields, respectively. Then, the hybrid-field channel could be represented by the combination of near-field and far-field channel components, where an adjustable parameter was also introduced to control the proportion of two types of path components. This hybrid-field channel model provides fundamentals for hybrid-field based communications."

More specifically, channel estimation, beamforming scheme design, and deep learning-empowered processing are reviewed in this section. Again, due to the extremely large array aperture, signal processing schemes for XL-MIMO systems would involve very high computational complexity. Thus, to promote practical implementation and meet the green communication demands for future communications, low-complexity signal processing schemes for XL-MIMO should be developed. Thus, in this section, we summarize and motivate low-complexity signal processing schemes for XL-MIMO. Many low-complexity signal processing schemes with different channel characteristics, design ideas, and design algorithms are reviewed."

The authors proposed a DS-NF channel estimation scheme based on the DS-NF channel model where the LoS path component was modeled under the geometric free space assumption and the NLoS path components are modeled by the near-field array response vector. In the DS-NF channel estimation scheme, a hierarchical parameter estimation algorithm was proposed to estimate the LoS path component, and an OMP based algorithm was utilized to estimate NLoS path components. It was numerically demonstrated that the DS-NF scheme achieved the best performance out of both the SS-NF OMP scheme in [69] and the conventional far-field OMP scheme."

By simplifying the channel for the far-field, there were two parameters needed to be estimated. The near-field channel could be represented as the superposition of the farfield channels by partitioning the continuous aperture into tiles which holds the far-field assumption. Moreover, an iterative channel estimation algorithm was proposed by exploiting the specific structure of the radiated beams generated by the continuous aperture. It was verified that the training overhead and computational complexity of the proposed estimation scheme did not scale with the number of antennas. Moreover, the proposed scheme outperformed benchmark schemes, especially in the poor scattering environment."

Based on the refined OMP algorithm, a subarray-wise scheme was proposed for channel estimation by iteratively estimating and refining the position information. Moreover, a scatterer-wise channel estimation scheme was investigated by positioning each scatterer and detecting its visibility regions to further improve accuracy. It was numerically demonstrated that the subarray-wise method could recover the channel with low complexity, and the scatterer-wise method could accurately identify almost all the mappings between sub-arrays and scatterers. However, the scatterer-wise method utilized the multiple sub-array gain to estimate the positions and VRs of the scatters, thereby achieving much more accurate positioning and mapping results. Therefore, the subarray-wise method was suitable for the low-complexity subarray-based transceiver design. The scatterer-wise method entailed a substantially efficient and comprehensive globalized transceiver design."

Due to the spatial non-stationarity, XL-MIMO forms VRs, which leads to a subarray-wise sparse structure of the channel. These schemes suppose that the user activities are operated in grant-free access mode, in which only a fraction of the potential users is active during a given time slot. Therefore, the channel possesses a doubly-sparse and user-specific structure which can be modeled by a nested Bernoulli-Gaussian distribution."

Based on the nested Bernoulli-Gaussian model, the authors proposed a novel bilinear inference-based JACE algorithm by decomposing the nested Bernoulli-Gaussian random variable into a bilinear inference problem of two independent random quantities. The proposed algorithm was effective for grant-free access and could achieve the genie-aided ideal estimation performance. Furthermore, different from the most closely-related bilinear generalized approximate message passing algorithm, the authors in [63] employed the belief combining strategy tailored for this specific bilinear problem and proposed an iterative JACE algorithm. To further enhance the practicality of the proposed algorithm, an EM-based auto-parameterization method was proposed to estimate instantaneous sub-array activity factors in [63]. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was revealed by the performance assessments via Monte-Carlo simulations in the NMSE and activity error rate (AER) performance."

Therefore, the trade-off between performance and complexity is an important challenge. The conventional minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) channel estimation is rarely adopted in XL-MIMO due to its high complexity. Then, the conventional least-squares (LS) scheme, which requires no prior statistical information, was used to estimate the channel of XL-MIMO with low computational complexity in [85], [168]. However, the LS estimation scheme achieved a poor performance at the low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) scenarios. Thus, it is necessary to investigate low-complexity channel estimation schemes with high accuracy and acceptable complexity. Next, we introduce two low-complexity schemes in detail."

The proposed RS-LS scheme utilized the compact eigenvalue decomposition of the spatial correlation matrix and exploited the array geometry. To circumvent the knowledge of the correlation matrix of a particular UE, the authors utilized the compact eigenvalue decomposition of the correlation matrix in an isotropic scattering environment to construct the conservative RS-LS estimator. It was shown that the RS-LS scheme outperformed the conventional statistics-unaware LS scheme and yielded similar NMSE performance as the MMSE estimation scheme with increasing SNR at a much lower complexity. Moreover, the conservative RS-LS estimator achieved a 6 dB NMSE gain lower than LS but still had about 5 dB NMSE performance gap higher than RS-LS due to the higher rank of its applied isotropic correlation matrix than the actual correlation matrix."

The proposed model captured the structured sparsity in the antenna-delay domain with the non-stationary property. Then, a low-complexity channel estimation scheme called the turbo orthogonal approximate message passing (turbo-OAMP) algorithm was proposed to efficiently perform the Bayesian inference. The turbo-OAMP consisted of a linear minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) estimator and a non-linear MMSE estimator designed based on the loopy belief propagation (LBP) and OAMP. Note that the turbo-OAMP employed the LBP to achieve the approximate Bayesian inference instead of the MMSE module in conventional OAMP. In contrast to the existing state-of-the-art baselines, such as the turbo-OAMP with i.i.d. Bernoulli Gaussian prior [169], sub-array OMP [76] and variational Bayesian inference (VBI) with the Dirichlet process [170], the proposed turbo-OAMP algorithm achieved better NMSE performance with substantially reduced pilot overheads, especially in low SNR scenarios."

However, some estimation schemes cannot achieve satisfactory estimation accuracy. The high accuracy of some schemes comes at a cost of higher complexity. Recently, machine learning based channel estimation schemes have been explored to excavate the characteristics for the channel with both improved channel estimation performance and low complexity. Machine learning-based channel estimation methods can be divided into two categories: model-driven [171], [172] and data-driven [173], [174]. The existing model-driven methods are more applicable and tractable than the data-driven ones with the preferable interpretability, simpler modeling, and lower complexity for training [171]. Three practical residual neural networks were proposed to obtain accurate channel state information in the RIS-aided mmWave communication system in [175]. The proposed neural network models leveraged the low-rank structure of RIS cascaded channels based on the similarity between the image noise reduction and channel estimation. Moreover, the proposed models could achieve better NMSE performance than conventional CS algorithms and"

The polar-domain representation of the XL-MIMO channel, which was based on the array response vector in [69], was considered. Based on the multiple residual dense network (MRDN) architecture [175], a polar-domain multiple residual dense network (P-MRDN)-based channel estimation scheme was proposed to utilize the channel sparsity in the polar-domain in XL-MIMO systems. Furthermore, a polar-domain multi-scale residual dense network (P-MSRDN)-based channel estimation scheme was proposed by exploiting the multi-scale feature integration capabilities of atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) in [176]. Notably, the proposed P-MRDN and P-MSRDN outperformed the LS method, the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm [177], the polar-OMP (P-OMP) method [74], and the MRDN [175]. Although the proposed P-MRDN and P-MSRDN had higher computational complexity than the P-OMP, all these schemes involved a similar order of magnitude of running time."

Moreover, the THz hybrid-field channel was considered, where the complex-valued channel response modeling scheme was implemented. A unified and theoretical DL-based channel estimation framework called fixed point networks (FPNs) was proposed. The proposed framework leveraged existing iterative channel estimators, where each iteration was implemented based on an FPN. It was shown that the proposed schemes perfectly matched the XL-MIMO scenario due to the low complexity and the scalability of other heavily out-of-distribution scenarios."

Then, a two-phase channel estimation scheme was proposed to capture the features of the HSPM. In the first phase, a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) was developed to estimate the channel parameters of the HSPM with reduced complexity and high estimation accuracy. In the second phase, the proposed algorithm explored the relations of parameters between the reference and remaining sub-arrays. Then, the channel matrix was reconstructed for the channel estimation. Compared to other methods, such as the OMP [179], AMP [180], CNN [181], and RNN [182] based methods, the proposed channel estimation scheme converged fast and achieved high accuracy with 5.2 dB NMSE improvement and had substantially low complexity."

Specifically, the polar domain-based schemes encounter increased complexity since the sampling dimension in the polar domain is several times the number of antennas. Parameter-based channel estimation schemes focus on estimating key channel parameters (i.e., the distance and angle information) based on near-field characteristics and then reconstructing the channel utilizing these parameters. The parameter-based schemes often rely on the specific structure of the antenna array or channel, such as the radiated beams [89], [96], the subarray architecture, and the properties of the scatterer [76]. Compared to the channel estimation schemes that estimate an entire channel, the complexity of parameter-based channel estimation schemes can be slightly reduced."

Linear signal beamforming schemes, such as maximal ratio (MR), zero-forcing (ZF), and minimum mean-square error (MMSE), are practical candidates for mMIMO systems. As the number of antennas increases, the algorithm's complexity needs to be reduced further. In doing so, a few low-complexity beamforming schemes have been proposed. In this part, we review the beamforming schemes design for XL-MIMO from the perspective of conventional linear beamforming schemes, low-complexity beamforming schemes, and optimization design for beamforming schemes."

The authors in [65] considered the scenario with UPA-based XL-MIMO with patch antennas serving two single-antenna users. They compared different precoding schemes and found that ZF precoding outperformed MR. More specifically, a reconfigurable holographic surface-assisted low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite communication system was designed by the authors in [102]. Moreover, they developed a holographic beamforming algorithm for sum rate maximization and derived a closed-form optimal holographic beamformer. To maximize ZF precoded XL-MIMO downlink SE, the authors in [82] proposed efficient resource allocation (RA) procedures. With the aid of the proposed RA procedures, the ZF based quasi-distributed algorithm could outperform the centralized one with approximate operation settings."

This method, as seen in [92] and [139], has been utilized to design uplink receivers for XL-MIMO systems to minimize computational complexity while balancing performance. Specifically, in [139], RK-based distributed receivers were studied with the sub-array architecture and spatial non-stationarity. The RK algorithm was applied at each sub-array to find the solution of the SLE. Then, the distributed linear data fusion (DLDF) receiver at the CPU was implemented as in [77]."

The GRK was a greedy scheme that applied the complete residual information of the SLE to accelerate the convergence further. Different from GRK, the RSK applied partial residual information to solve the SLE with a much smaller amount of information compared with that of the GRK. Numerical results demonstrated that the RK-RZF based on the SwoR acceleration method could reduce the computational complexity by nearly "

The authors in [79], [87] proposed low-complexity expectation propagation (EP) detectors for XL-MIMO systems. The authors in [79] investigated the uplink sub-array based architecture, where the sub-array based EP detector was implemented at each sub-array in parallel. When considering the sub-array based architecture, the matrix inversion at the EP detector could be computed recursively as [79, Algorithm 2]. Moreover, the authors in [87] studied uplink PE-EP detectors, where the matrix inversion in each EP iteration was approximated by polynomial expansion (PE). Based on the low-complexity PE approximation, the PE-EP detectors had much lower computational complexity, i.e., "

Besides, they proposed the leveraging Neumann series (NS) expansion to replace the matrix inversion in the ZF precoding scheme. More specifically, in the NS based method, the matrix inversion was decomposed into the main diagonal matrix and off-diagonal matrix, and then the matrix inversion could be represented based on these decomposed matrices. Numerical results demonstrated that the NS based ZF precoding could achieve similar performance to that of the original ZF precoding while avoiding high complexity matrix inversion. Moreover, applying 4 NS iterations to approximate the matrix inversion was efficient in achieving a good trade-off for the performance and complexity."

The authors in [186] compared optimization tools, e.g., numerical techniques, reinforcement learning methods, and AI-generated optimization, for addressing near-field resource allocation, emphasizing their strengths and limitations. More specifically, the beamforming precoding matrix and power control strategy were studied as use cases. For the fully-digital and hybrid fully-connected precoding architecture design, the authors in [186] compared an AI-generated optimization method [188] with optimal beamforming [189], Riemannian manifold optimization [110], alternating optimization [110], and reinforcement learning [190]. It was observed that the AI-generated optimization method was suitable in the complex and ever-changing scenario."

The ZF digital beamformer was implemented, and the holographic beamforming scheme was optimized to maximize the sum rate. The Lagrangian multiplier-associated method was implemented to solve the optimization problems. The proposed scheme had guaranteed robustness since the tracking errors of the satellites' positions could have few effects on the sum rate."

Furthermore, the optimization problem of maximizing the SE was formulated. Then, the DAP algorithm was proposed as [84, Algorithm 1] to optimize the digital precoder, analog precoder, adjustable selection matrix, power allocation matrix, and number of data streams to maximize the SE performance based on the alternating optimization. The authors demonstrated that the proposed DAP precoding scheme could achieve a two-times increase in the SE performance compared to classical hybrid precoding schemes."

Besides, the baseband combiner and the weight matrix, a configurable weight matrix denoting the array's response, were optimized to maximize the achievable sum rate. The equivalent matrix-weighted MMSE was applied to transform the sum-rate maximization objective to a simpler equivalent objective, where the equivalent matrix-weighted MMSE problem was convex to the optimized variables [191]. Then, the alternating optimization method was adopted to derive a feasible solution. The proposed framework could effectively alleviate the sum-rate loss introduced by near-field and dual-wideband effects."

Thus, it is important to design the pattern, i.e., the electric current density distribution, to achieve improved performance. A pattern-division multiplexing technique was proposed in [59] for the scenario where one BS equipped with a 2D CAP plane serving multiple UEs also equipped with 2D CAP planes. The sum capacity maximization problem was formulated to optimize the pattern. Furthermore, the weighted MMSE approach was adopted to derive the equivalent transformation of the sum capacity maximization problem. Then, the pattern functions and receiving combiners were designed based on iterative optimization. The pattern-division multiplexing technique showed the potential for XL-MIMO to control the electric current density to approach outstanding performance."

It is vital to consider the energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem for sustainability [192]. The authors in [107] investigated the EE maximization problem for the uplink transmission. An algorithmic framework to design the transmit precoding of each multi-antenna UE and the tuning strategy was considered, considering the instantaneous or statistical channel state information (CSI). Then, the algorithmic framework was implemented using Dinkelbach's transform, alternating optimization, and deterministic equivalent methods."

Thus, many low-complexity processing schemes for XL-MIMO are discussed. All these schemes inspire the low-complexity design and promote the practical implementation of XL-MIMO. To design the low-complexity beamforming schemes, novel array architectures, such as the sub-array architecture with distributed learning, and efficient algorithms, such as the RK algorithms, VMP algorithms, and low-complexity matrix inversion algorithms, are applied. To promote further research on low-complexity beamforming schemes for XL-MIMO, intelligent array architecture and network architecture, such as the distributed architecture [38] and modular architecture [100] are advocated to provide flexible and efficient processing. Further, other low-complexity algorithms and machine-learning networks can also be applied to design lightweight beamforming schemes for XL-MIMO. Additionally, optimization design for beamforming schemes has also been reviewed. These studies can motivate further research on optimization design for XL-MIMO systems with different optimization scenarios, objectives, and methods to exploit the potential of XL-MIMO fully."

However, the machine learning based methods can capture the inherent characteristics of the channel. Hence, the related algorithms, e.g., the machine learning based channel estimation, machine learning based beamforming, distributed learning, and so on, are proposed for different application scenarios [193], [194]. The machine learning based channel estimation has been reviewed and motivated in Section IV-A5 so that we focus on the machine learning based beamforming and distributed learning in this part."

One of the advantages is the protection against eavesdroppers in similar angular orientations, which can otherwise threaten communication security under planar-wavefront propagation. In addition, the authors developed a leakage subspace precoding technique for secure precoding and user scheduling [71].

They considered both colluding and non-colluding strategies of eavesdroppers, providing a comprehensive understanding of the PLS implications for various scenarios. The investigation determined that the propagation characteristics associated with the SW model resulted in higher secrecy rates than that of the PW model [47]. The SW model reduces the regions where an eavesdropper can render the attack, emphasizing the need to consider the appropriate propagation"

The authors in [209] also examined the space-time-frequency correlation function, quasi-stationary interval, and Doppler power spectrum and derived closed-form expressions for the survival probabilities of clusters. Alternatively, the authors in [91] proposed a double-scattering XL-MIMO channel model for accurately representing spatial non-stationarity in"

The authors also evaluated the model for uniform linear and planar array (ULA and UPA) antenna configurations. Through Monte-Carlo simulations, performance metrics such as SINR, condition number (CN), and SE were analyzed for linear combiners MRC, ZF, and MMSE. Considering XL-MIMO-aided UAV communications, both [91] and [209] provide valuable insights for developing advanced channel models and system performance analysis. Specifically, the mmWave UAV MIMO channel model proposed in [209] can be combined with the double-scattering XL-MIMO channel model in [91] to create a comprehensive channel model that addresses both UAV communication scenarios and XL-MIMO system characteristics. The proposed channel models and their analyses can serve as guidelines for designing effective UAV communication systems for future space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) and 6G wireless networks."

The objective is to reduce the network's overall energy consumption while maintaining a specific QoS for the users. In this context, the optimization problem entails joint UAV trajectory and RIS phase decisions in order to minimize the downlink transmission power of the UAV and base station. The authors proposed a successive convex approximation (SCA) method to resolve this problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can provide a guaranteed minimum rate while minimizing the transmission power of the UAV and BS. The proposed optimization framework in [210] can be extended to XL-MIMO systems when immense antenna arrays and their potential to improve communication efficiency are taken into account [211]. By incorporating XL-MIMO features into the optimization problem, the energy consumption of UAVs and BSs can be reduced further."

This research surpasses conventional uniform plane wave (UPW) models. It offers valuable insights for designing and implementing XL-MIMO radar and XL-phased-array radar modes in mobile networks [47]. In a related study, the authors in [215] investigated near-field radio sensing utilizing XL antenna arrays. Using a uniform spheric wave (USW) sensing model, they developed closed-form expressions for the Cramér-Rao Bounds (CRBs) for angle and range estimations in near-field XL-MIMO radar mode and XL-phased array radar mode [215]. This study highlights the practical limitations of antenna array size in near-field sensing and provides insight into the tradeoffs between array size and estimation precision."

In high-density XL-MIMO systems, they introduced a QoS-aware joint user scheduling and power allocation method for downlink channels. This method consists of two sequential steps: a clique-based scheduling algorithm for user scheduling and optimal power allocation subject to transmit power budget and minimum achievable rate per user constraints. The paper presented a generalized non-stationary multi-state channel model based on spherical-wave propagation to evaluate the proposed technique. The multipath fading model and the path loss rule account for users in different channel conditions encountering different propagation characteristics [195]. By integrating these factors, the authors in [81] contributed"

Navigating through high-density connections involves more than mere numerical management as it demands adept communication orchestration, particularly using QoS-aware joint user scheduling and distance-aware precoding architectures. XL-MIMO's capacity extends beyond throughput enhancement, ensuring each IoT device, from low-power sensors to high-demand surveillance cameras, attains its communication needs efficiently and with minimal latency. This involves a strategic adaptation of communication parameters via techniques like adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) and is crucial in maintaining reliable, low-latency communication across a densely populated network. Utilizing sophisticated algorithms safeguards the communication integrity amongst an array of IoT devices, each with varied communication and performance requirements, highlighting the pivotal role of XL-MIMO in managing spectral and spatial resources effectively."

They created a joint communication and computing resource allocation (JCCRA) problem to minimize energy consumption while meeting the delay constraints [75]. They proposed a distributed cooperative solution strategy based on the multi-agent, deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm. Compared to heuristic baselines, simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed strategy, emphasizing a reduction in total energy consumption of up to five times. This study serves as a guide that an integration of XL-MIMO and edge computing has a potential to facilitate energy-efficient, low-latency communication and processing in future wireless networks."

The proposed NOVR-XL solution merges non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with XL-MIMO, specifically for random access in saturated mMTC XL-MIMO contexts. Notably, NOVR-XL allows multiple overlapping users to engage with the same XL subarray, improving the average sum rate from 160 to 520 bits/channel use when the average number of UEs contending by the pilot is 2, outperforming the strongest user collision resolution scheme."

For example, XL-MIMO systems with their extremely large-scale antenna arrays can benefit from AI-based beamforming strategies since AI solutions can exploit the near-field environment effects dynamically to improve the SINR and SE [84]. Additionally, AI-enabled user scheduling algorithms, such as the one proposed in [81], can optimize resource allocation for IoT networks by considering the high-density user distribution typical of XL-MIMO scenarios. Future research could delve deeper into the potential of generative AI, e.g., generative diffusion models [221], [222], in generating the optimal resource allocation schemes according to the user behavior and network conditions in XL-MIMO systems."

For instance, the authors in [197] demonstrated an application of reinforcement Q-learning for optimal content caching in IoT-enabled multi-cell mMIMO systems, achieving considerable energy efficiency gains. Furthermore, energy-aware activation of RF chains in XL-MIMO systems was proposed in [84]. By leveraging energy-aware algorithms, the system can dynamically adjust the number of active RF chains based on real-time communication requirements. This strategy allows for a flexible response to the increased DoFs in the near-field region, ensuring an optimal balance between energy consumption and system performance."

SemCom can improve network efficiency and reduce the burden of wireless data transmission by extracting and transmitting task-related semantic information from source data [224], [225]. In particular, the semantic information encoder can extract semantic features from the source data. These extracted features, being more compact than the original data, reduce the necessity for unnecessary wireless transmissions, thereby promoting the deployment of URLLC [226]. Additionally, the implementation of the XL-MIMO technique can enhance the efficacy of the SemCom system. More specifically, an attention feature module incorporated into the semantic encoder can utilize these extracted features to produce a series of scaling parameters [31], [227]. These parameters, symbolizing the significance of the semantic features, can guide resource allocation and beamforming design [228]. For instance, under conditions of constrained network resources, intricate beamforming schemes can prioritize the transmission of more critical semantic information, consequently ensuring error-free communication [229]."

Specifically, enhanced physical layer security can be achieved by harnessing the large-scale antenna arrays inherent in XL-MIMO systems to generate secure communication channels, thereby complicating the interception of transmissions by eavesdroppers and offering a degree of defense against jamming attacks [91]. Concurrently, the near-field effects unique to XL-MIMO systems provide an opportunity to devise innovative location-based authentication schemes, thereby ensuring network access is restricted to legitimate users within a specific spatial region and mitigating risks"

This can provide invaluable feedback for refining XL-MIMO technology's design, implementation, and optimization. For example, the work in [217] demonstrates the effectiveness of a distributed approach for minimizing energy consumption in CF mMIMO-enabled mobile edge networks, which could serve as a basis for further experimental evaluation. Similarly, the DAP architecture proposed in [84] could benefit from experimental validation to confirm its effectiveness in exploiting the near-field effects for capacity improvement in 6G XL-MIMO networks. The development of XL-MIMO testbeds would also facilitate the exploration of various aspects, such as channel modeling, antenna array configurations, and user distribution, under realistic network conditions. In addition, the establishment of standardized benchmarks for the evaluation and comparison of different XL-MIMO algorithms and architectures would significantly contribute to the advancement of this technology. Overall, experimental evaluations and testbed development are crucial for bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical implementation of XL-MIMO systems."

By offering the unique characteristics of communicating in the radiative near-field, XL-MIMO is considered one of the promising technologies to support the ambitious goals of 6G. In this context, this paper has provided a comprehensive review of XL-MIMO, an integral part of 6G wireless communications. Four promising XL-MIMO hardware designs and their characteristics were first introduced. Then, we presented various channel modeling schemes for XL-MIMO, which provided essential fundamentals and insights for the research on XL-MIMO. Furthermore, a comprehensive review and motivation of signal processing schemes, particularly those with low complexity, were conducted to facilitate the practical implementation of XL-MIMO. Last, many XL-MIMO-empowered application scenarios and future directions for XL-MIMO were highlighted. Our survey serves as a guideline for primary XL-MIMO research works in future 6G communications from the perspective of hardware design schemes, channel modeling, low-complexity signal processing design, XL-MIMO-empowered application scenarios, and promising future directions."
