While retaining its core philosophy the original version of the case method has been modified repeatedly. This has been necessitated due to the challenges of implementing the method in a variety of contexts; especially the changing nature of the student body, and advances in technology. The purpose of this paper is to review in one place the more recent innovations in the case method of teaching in business schools and the motivation for these innovations as found in the academic literature since the dawn of the 21st century. We also speculate on some of the teaching innovations we can anticipate in future."

Anecdotal evidence suggests that, at the turn of the 21st century, the CCM was the most common way of teaching with cases, although not always in its pure form (Booth et al., 2001). Traditionally, a case is a written description of a real business situation focusing on a problem to be solved at a particular point in time by one or more protagonists. The case provides selected data that are relevant to the decision and are expected to be used by students in their analysis. Cases and their associated teaching notes are usually written by the instructor with the assistance of a case writer and are widely available from a number of sources such as the Harvard Business School, Ivey Publishing, the Case Centre and others."

In these four activities students (1) read background materials such as journal articles, technical notes or chapters from a text; (2) individually read and analyze the case, taking on the role of the protagonist; (3) meet in teams to discuss the case; and (4) attend a classroom session facilitated by the instructor. Under some circumstances the students are required to submit a written analysis for grading. When adopting the role of the protagonist, students are expected to go through a series of steps in their analysis including understanding the situation (sensemaking), identifying the decision maker and the problem to be solved, generating and evaluating alternative solutions (modelling), reaching a decision, and formulating an action plan. This series of analytical steps is repeated during the individual student preparation, learning team discussions and the plenary session."

These were the internationalization of business programs, the changing nature of the student body, and advances in technology and how it is used. In response to the globalization of the world economy the content of business programs has increasingly emphasized an international business component. Through exchange programs and cooperative arrangements among business schools the student body has become much more internationally diverse (Global classrooms, 2025). Students enrolled in business programs are increasingly from the Millennium Generation which was formerly known as generation Y. These persons were born in roughly 1981 to 1996 and came of age in the new Millennium. According to Oblinger (2003) and Matulich et al. (2008) they are characterized as ethnically diverse, engaged in multitasking, keep in contact with others, and include a larger proportion of females They are technologically savvy, willing to embrace change, reflective, responsive to visual information, do little reading (except when required), prefer self-paced, any time any place learning, and desire to be engaged. These characteristics suggest that changes should be made in the design and delivery of case-based courses and programs especially as it relates to greater use of technology. As noted by Rollag and Billsberry (2012) advances in computing power and especially interaction with the WEB has made it possible for persons to engage each other from many locations and to interact with each other in real time or on a delayed basis. It has also made it possible to access a wide range of information that is received in many formats such as spreadsheets, streaming videos, photos, interactive diagrams and so on. Interaction with the WEB can take place employing a variety of devices such as phones, laptops, and iPads. All of these technological advances provide the opportunity to radically change how we teach and learn."

Abstracts of all published refereed papers covering the period from 2000 to 2024 were scanned, noting those papers in which the authors self-identified their approach as the case method, focused on management education, described how they conducted the case method in a tertiary business education context, and mentioned some inadequacy in the case method and an innovation being proposed to address the inadequacy. For each paper selected we reviewed the bibliographies and added any papers from the 2000–2024 period that were not previously identified. Empirical papers that dealt exclusively with the efficacy of the case method (usually relative to some other method such as lecturing or simulation) were excluded on the grounds that they did not deal with the introduction of new innovations and such empirical papers had already been summarized elsewhere (Hatch & Mu, 2024). We also did not include papers that described how the case method can be used in new contexts, such as the introduction of the case method in courses, programs or regions where it had never been used before, because no new innovations in the method were being proposed. This search process uncovered 84 papers."

We then reviewed our list of motivations and concluded that there were five broad types of motivations for the papers which were used to form the structure of this paper. These are: (1) difficulty in managing classroom processes, (2) the inadequacy of traditional faculty written cases, (3) difficulty in engaging students in their own learning, (4) the challenges of managing course and program design, and (5) the challenges of managing online case-based classes. Exhibit 1 shows the types of papers identified and the dates of their publication grouped into five year periods."

The challenges of implementing these steps within a classroom environment have been well documented (Bridgman et al., 2016). The following papers highlight a number of these challenges and propose a variety of innovative versions of the case method for addressing them."

To improve pre-class preparation Harrison-Walker (2000) has students hand in their individual analysis in advance of the case discussion and grades it. Not only does this process lead to better pre-class preparation but it also leads to enhanced classroom participation and more in-depth discussion. Purkayastha (2019) contends that comic book cases address the lack of pre-class preparation quite well because they can be read quickly, and they can actually be read in the classroom. Even though they are short they are also very effective in stimulating high levels of classroom discussion."

Sometimes the students are allowed to choose their own teams but this can lead to forming teams consisting only of those who are friends, have a common ethnic background, or have a common educational background. The result is that the individual teams lack diversity in areas such as gender, skills, knowledge, and past experience. Having diversity in teams is important for at least two reasons; it reflects the likely makeup of teams students will experience in the workplace and it provides a richness of perspectives that facilitates learning from cases. How is this diversity achieved? Harrison-Walker (2000) has each student fill out a card on which the students rank themselves \"on a variety of skills (such as critical thinking, leadership, computer skills, presentation skills, creativity, and number crunching).\" (2000, p. 241). He then assigns the students to groups in such a way that each group contains a balance of strengths and weaknesses."

(2024) have observed that the instructional innovations that have taken place in case teaching have failed to ensure two necessary conditions that enable student learning in groups: (1) the establishment of group goals and (2) individual accountability for team outputs. To address this problem they propose what they call the Table Case Method. This approach takes the view that students should be trained to apply the theory that they are learning to actual business situations. Students are exposed to lectures on business theories then, operating in teams, and assisted by rubrics, they perform an analysis of a case. For each case they are supplied with four theories that may or may not apply to the case and are asked to identify and justify their preferred theory. Following individual responses to the question the student teams are asked to come up with a team response. Students are assessed based on their individual preparation and their contribution to the group response. This is followed by a debrief from each of the groups in a plenary class session. The last step is to provide students with a final written assessment of their performance that is intended to lead to individual student reflection on what they have learned."

To provide students with experience in operating effective teams they require student teams to write a case based on a composite of their personal experiences incorporating the knowledge derived from the course. During the case writing activity the students are provided with extensive guidance on team operation. An additional feature of their approach is that students must evaluate the contribution of team members and if a member engages in social loafing the identified student does not pass the course."

It is common for the instructor to act as the conduit for all classroom discussion but that requires students to voluntarily participate and to be actively engaged in the learning process. Two barriers to effective utilization of classroom dialogue are having a stress inducing environment and one that focuses on winning arguments rather than achieving personal learning. Gomes and Knowles (2000) discuss a variety of techniques that they have successfully employed to address these challenges all of which lead to a trusting environment and reduced psychological fear of speaking out. They divide their strategies into two parts: stress reducing and performance enhancing. They lower stress by providing students with substantial amounts of advance information on what one can expect from the case method; utilizing a routine structure for each case class; and engaging in team building exercises such as having students meet in small groups to discuss the cases in advance of the class. Performance is enhanced by encouraging students to set their own learning goals, having them model the behavior of the instructor and other students, and using a variety of devices to improve their self-confidence."

He feels that students will remember what they have learned because we remember better if emotions are attached to the learning. Holtom et al.

This approach leads to a very high degree of student participation in the subsequent discussions led by the instructor. Other teachers view the students in the classroom as a group that must function as a cooperative team. Improvisation derived from experience with comedy troupes or jazz composition has been proposed to enhance such team functioning. For example, Aylesworth (2008) asserts that improvisation exercises enhance classroom discussion by teaching students to accept and build on the comments of others, removing some of the competitive attitude normally found in the classroom and building a more collaborative mindset among students. In contrast with instructors who see dialogue as a cooperative exercise, Pearce (2002) has successfully employed structured conflict to engage students in classroom dialogue. Under this approach two groups provide their analysis of the case and debate which one is most appropriate. The remainder of the class contributes comments in favor of or against one of the groups' analysis. In an attempt to motivate students, enhance their critical thinking skills and introduce the complexity of sustainability issues into the classroom through active student engagement in dialogue, Georgallis and Bruijn (2022) utilize a similar approach which they call the case-based debate. Prior to a class teams are formed. Two teams are given the task of reading the case and being prepared to debate an issue provided by the instructor. The remainder of the class also read the case and are expected to play the role of a \"jury\". The class begins with an instructor presented overview of the case and is followed by opening statements in support of their position by each debating team. Next, there are two sessions (interrupted by time to prepare) in which the teams each put forward a rebuttal of their opponents' position. This is followed by a series of questions asked by the jury of both sides of the debate. Finally, the jury anonymously chooses the winner by secret ballot. To evaluate the teams' performance the jury provides anonymous feedback to the instructor. The instructor then provides a grade to each team as well as written feedback to the entire class on lessons learned."

Harrison-Walker (2000) assigns a team to present a case and has another team critique the presentation. The presenters then respond to the critique followed by an open discussion by the whole class moderated by the instructor. Another variant of this approach is called the MICA method (Desiraju & Gopinath, 2001). Under this method all students suggest a list of action steps that should be discussed and an administrative team of students takes charge of the classroom discussion. From the list of action steps the administrative team selects those that are most interesting and asks the students who proposed them, to justify their action, followed by an open classroom discussion of each one. The instructor, who has acted as an observer, provides a summary of the learning that has occurred as well as feedback on various student comments that have been made."

Rosier (2002) asserts that reflection seldom takes place after the case experience is complete since the students quickly move on to other activities. In response he has students write a brief reflective report after each case class is completed. To ensure that the reflection leads to change in student skills and knowledge he provides a series of guideline questions such as how the student would analyze the case if they had a chance to do it again, the lessons learned from the case method process, and how these learnings could be applied in the workplace. In an approach taken from the arts Maranville (2011) conducts a capstone case class and at the conclusion asks the students to capture their strategic vision for the company as a work of art in the form of an oil painting. This is accompanied by a one page abstract describing the painting and the underlying principles of strategic management that it depicts. He contends the scientific approach to analysis typically found in strategic management courses limits strategic thinking. In contrast this exercise stimulates deeper reflection and innovative ways of thinking about business strategy."

A student's contribution can have many elements, from simple frequency of participation to furthering the analysis of the case and critiquing the comments of other students. Some faculty rely on their memory to assign scores to each member of the class immediately after the end of the class. This can be challenging; especially if the class is large. Mainkar (2008) uses two classmates to record classroom contribution for each class and notes a very high correlation between the scores provided by the two scorers, thus ensuring its reliability. The result of using this method is that the instructor is able to focus all of their effort on managing the learning environment rather than being distracted by the need to recall the contribution of each student. Mu and Hatch (2019) describe a much more elaborate contribution measurement system. A PhD student, who is also the grader of the final exam and is an expert in the functional area, sits in on each class. Based on a rubric provided by the instructor the student records a score for contribution for each student based on a scale from 0 to 4. At the end of the class the instructor and the doctoral student meet to verify that they agree on the scores and then they are placed in an excel spreadsheet. The cumulative scores for each student are used as input to assign a final contribution grade for the course."

As a solution to this problem, a number of authors such as Rochford and Borchert (2011) have proposed the use of a rubric for the grading of reports and final exams. Their innovation is that the rubric is provided to the students at the beginning of the course in order to set clear standards for the students in advance and to provide an opportunity to assess whether or not individual students or the class as a group are improving their performance over time. Riddle et al. (2016) also provide a rubric for evaluating student learning based on a review of written case assignments. Their rubric is divided into four categories; application of theories and concepts to the case, identification of the significant issues in the case, making decisions based on analytical reasoning and sound judgement, and synthesizing the case analysis to provide reasonable recommendations. One of the challenges facing instructors is the time it takes to read student case assignments. To address this issue Pitt and Page (2006) have students deliver their assignment in the form of Power Point slides. These have the advantages of being easy to grade and giving the students more time to focus on the core aspects of their analysis and avoid time spent on writing."

                                    "content": "One of the challenges in employing the traditional case method is that in the classroom it is difficult to capture the subtle interpersonal interactions commonly found in the workplace. To address this issue Kerr et al. (2003) teach a case using a role play. The students read the case in advance and selected students are designated to play the roles of the protagonists in the case thus introducing the dynamics normally found in a real situation. The remainder of the class act as observers. After the role playing is complete the instructor debriefs the experience pointing out what has been learned. Employing a different approach Dean and Fornaciari (2002) have all students read the case and come up with their own strategic plan based on the information in the case. Before the class, a small group of students is identified to play the roles of the protagonists in the case and must jointly come up with a strategic plan for the company in front of the other students. An open discussion among the protagonists takes place leading to some conclusion or reconciliation of points of view. The key feature of the role play is that the response of a student is dependent on the responses of other players in the role play, thus adding a new dimension of realism and interpersonal dynamics into the exercise The remainder of the class plays the role of a Greek chorus that intervenes when the role players drop out of character or do not appropriately use the facts given in the case. Faucher (2009) uses a case designed to simulate the negotiations that take place between a manufacturer and one of its suppliers. The students are divided into groups representing either the manufacturer or the supplier. Each group is given detailed information on their firm and limited information on the other company. Through a series of negotiations the teams address a number of challenges in the supplier/manufacturer relationship. Jerrard (2005) designs a role play in which student teams play the roles of government, employer association, trade union and company. The goal is to address a number of employment relations issues affecting the four parties, thus reflecting the reality of negotiations involving many stakeholders. In addition, new information is introduced over time to reflect the temporal dynamics of decision making. Uslay (2007) employs what he calls the consultants case method to capture the workplace environment. Under this method the class is divided into teams and each team is assigned a case for which they will either play the role of management or the consultant. In the classroom the consultant team makes their presentation on recommended actions followed by a Q&A by all students and then the management team presents their response. This approach simulates the role of the management consultant; a career choice favored by many students and how the consultant and client may interact. It also provides the additional benefit of very active student involvement. Albert (2021) provides tools and methods aimed at improving students learning from the case method in several ways while at the same time appreciating the importance of departmental relationships within a firm. The students are given a detailed article on some major current event such as a proposed merger. The instructor takes on the role of the CEO and provides the class with a discussion of the challenges ahead. The students are then divided into teams. A leadership team is made up of the top executives of the key functional areas such as Human resources, Marketing, Technology and R&D/Innovation. This team meets with the instructor/CEO to develop the high level mission for the firm and what is generally expected from each functional area. The remaining students are placed in groups, each of which play the role of the management team in one of the functional areas. These functional area groups, along with the senior executive for the area, meet to discuss how the corporate strategy should be implemented in their area and prepare reports to be submitted to the class, taking care to consider cross functional issues. This is followed by a general class discussion and a summary of what has been learned. Using this approach the authors contend that the students are better able to engage in reflective, critical, and creative thinking."

One method of helping students understand this point is the use of simulation. A simulation is usually an exercise where individuals or teams make decisions and the results of each decision affect subsequent decisions that must be made. Simulations are commonly based on some type of computerized model or business game. Perez-Bennett et al. (2014) describe how to teach a traditional case which is followed by a simulation uniquely based on the case. The simulation helps students to make decisions within a real world environment and particularly demonstrates that a decision made now may lead to a new situation that also requires new courses of action."

Peterson and Govindarajulu (2003) address this issue by using historical cases that describe the decisions that were made by a company under a variety of conditions over an extended period of time in the past. Sometimes the analysis of these cases involves post auditing past decisions rather than making a current decision. However, the authors assert that the analysis of such cases conveys the view that a company's present situation is the result of choices made in the past. The cases also give readers an appreciation for the constant change in the internal and external environment within which corporations operate."

A decision making focus is often taken at the expense of a thorough sensemaking exercise or overlooking the implementation challenges of decisions once they are made. In an effort to address this issue of excessive focus on decision analysis Bridgeman (2010) has proposed that ethics cases should not focus on the ethical dilemma facing a specific manager but should have no decision maker at all. The case would instead center on sensemaking and understanding the economic, political and business conditions that led to such an event."

It also tends to ignore the complexities of the economic system and the legitimate roles of labor and government."

However this approach does not allow students to learn how to obtain and perform their own analysis of raw data and to interpret the results. To address this problem Smith and Bryant (2009) provide students with raw data along with the case and as part of their case assignment they must determine the relationships inherent in the data employing statistical techniques. Rather than simply focusing on a decision two papers describe case studies that attempt to simulate the realities of data gathering during the audit process. Davies (2000) was concerned that traditional cases used to teach the auditing of accounting computer systems were not sufficiently realistic because students were not required to engage in hands-on exercises involving real data. To address this issue she created discs containing a case, a workbook and a spreadsheet of source data. The case describes a company that has recently had its records computerized, the workbook guides the students through typical audit tasks, and the spreadsheet contains extensive data relating to the company's payroll system. The students' task, which takes place over a series of classes, is to familiarize themselves with the company and utilize the data to perform an audit followed by a presentation of the results in a written report. Dennis (2003) uses a similar approach. Students working in audit teams of about five students are required to conduct a simulated financial statement audit of a fictitious company. The audit teams have to accumulate sufficient and reliable audit evidence from various sources including supporting documentation, third party communications and questioning of the \"client staff\" who are role-played by teachers. They must communicate their results in audit memoranda and working papers provided to an audit partner who provides feedback on their progress. The extended case is employed over an entire course. Erzurumlu and Rollag (2013) give the students a two page case that provides an overview of the company and the issues it faces. Students, acting as consultants, are then permitted to ask written questions of the client (played by the instructor) who then responds with information derived from the real company. If the students don't request portions of the available information the information is not supplied. After several rounds of such questions the students are required to present a final consulting report. This approach is intended to reflect the reality that information is only provided if it is sought and that the quality of the analysis depends on ones' ability to ask the right questions. In another effort to make the learning from a case more practical, Sawyer et al."

The students are asked to gather relevant information from publicly available sources and submit a report on the appropriate tax strategy for the client in a format that reflects the kind of report normally submitted to real clients. Data analytics courses are increasingly offered to business students. Zhong and Kim (2024) present the students with a problem faced by a telecommunications company involving their customer churn. Along with a description of the business problem students are provided with a large amount of data to be analyzed. The data are downloaded into R which is a powerful tool for data analysis. The students can then utilize ChatGPT to interrogate the data. For example they can ask if there are any missing variables or ask R to perform a logistic regression and then use ChatGPT for its interpretation of the results. Using AI in this way allows the students to use R without having extensive prior programming knowledge. Students in information systems courses are often required to create models that allow them to understand and design an information system for a firm. Students are typically given a written case that is used as the basis for this assignment. The result is that the students build a formal model based on the case, however, they don't learn how to capture the reality of the firms operations that, in the real world, is generally acquired through field observations, interviews, and the analysis of documents. To address this limitation of written cases Henkel and Bider (2020) propose what they call an Apprenticeship Simulation. This simulation is based on an imaginary company. A web page is constructed containing multimedia information such as documents, excel spreadsheets, video interviews and Twitter Feeds. An instructor who is acting as a master provides online descriptions of the tasks required of the students and the exercise involves students, acting as apprentices, utilizing the data to carry out the tasks and complete a report."

An example of such an approach is provided by Fischbach (2015) who utilizes graphic novel cases in the teaching of business ethics to sales managers. She argues that because people are used to processing visual information combined with written information the graphic novel is superior to the traditional written case. Videos have long been used to complement written cases. O'Connell, McCarthy, and Hall (2004) experimented with cases that were offered in written form and those that were supplemented with a video or with the presence of the protagonist in class. They demonstrated that providing videos changes students' views regarding the leadership capabilities of the protagonist since body language contains valuable information. They also noted that bringing guest speakers into the classroom, if they are available, is even more desirable but is not often possible. Liedtka (2001) goes a step further by exclusively using videos as the format for a case. Students are presented with the video in class and the video is interrupted from time to time by the instructor who engages in a conversation with the class. She reports that video cases are considered especially useful in reflecting the complexity of real businesses and enhancing students' listening (as opposed to reading) comprehension. Sheppard and Vibert (2016), in a business strategy course, provide all of the case information to students in the form of unscripted video clips containing interviews with managers about the issues they face as well as clips that provide relevant corporate information. The students are expected to utilize these clips to identify the key problem faced by the organization and to propose a solution. They found that this approach is preferred by students relative to written cases especially because of the quality and quantity of the information provided. Finally, Jones and Kerr (2012) found that when using traditional written cases the reports written by the students were superficial and showed little evidence of higher order thinking. To address these issues they wanted to combine the characteristics of a site visit and a live business problem. They used a multimedia approach in which the students were provided with information on the company using many media such as pictures, videos of interviews with managers and employees, diagrams of business processes, financial data and so on. After several weeks the students were tasked with presenting their case analysis taking care to apply theory from the module in order to identify and solve operational problems and to relate these to the overall performance of the business. The authors found that this approach was perceived as engaging, realistic, challenging and facilitated greater student interest."

However these speakers are often not effective because they may not be engaging, familiar with the course content, or versed in the case method pedagogy. To address these issues Fawcett and Fawcett (2011) propose a new approach. They have an instructor write a case at a company and have the protagonist in the case review the case and the learning objectives. The protagonist is then brought into the classroom where students present their findings to the guest who engages in a dialogue with them. By providing the guest with a structure in advance the guest is more successful in their presentation."

There is evidence to support the assertion that greater student engagement in the case method leads to greater learning (Song et al., 2022). We now turn to a discussion of the various methods being employed to shift the development of cases and learning materials from the instructor to the students. These methods have a number of benefits relative to traditional cases, of which two of the most commonly mentioned are to engage students more fully in their own learning and to enhance their ability to internalize what is being learned (Desiraju & Gopinath, 2001)."

Students identify issues, gather data through interviews, access internal documents and secondary sources and write up the case along with their analysis and suggested action plan. The company is studied and discussed by the students in real time. In this way the students and company jointly address an issue that currently confronts the company. The learning benefits of live cases have been outlined by a number of authors (Kennedy et al., 2001; Roth & Smith, 2009). It is claimed that, in contrast to traditional written cases, live cases avoid the possibility that published cases may have \"solutions\" available in the public domain, are considered more engaging, offer more current issues to deal with, give students the feeling that they are helping solve a real problem that matters, and avoid the subjective biases introduced by traditional case writers. Live cases provide the opportunity to learn new skills such as framing the most important problems to be addressed and locating and gathering useful data from a variety of sources."

                                    "content": "A number of innovative ways of introducing live cases have been proposed. In a basic marketing course Forman (2006) asks his students to write a case at a company and then to conduct a traditional case class with their classmates in the presence of the participating company. He refers to this method as participative case writing. In a finance course McWilliams and Nahavandi (2006) ask students to utilize public information to research a current event with ethical overtones, write up a case describing all sides of the issue, present it in class and lead a discussion of the event among their classmates. These activities are expected to permit students to increase their emotional connection, understand how to collect and interpret facts and to enhance their critical thinking ability. In the information systems area Cameron et al. (2012) utilize a hybrid approach that they call a live teaching case which combines live cases and guest speakers. The instructor and a guest from the company (called an animator) jointly write and give the students a document containing background information on the company. The animator makes an oral presentation of the case in the classroom and identifies the decision that is being faced by management. Then, with the assistance of the instructor, the students engage in a discussion of how the problem should be solved. The students are able to ask the animator questions to obtain additional information as needed. In an auditing course Drake (2011) identifies a major current and ongoing event such as a fraud, taken from the media. Throughout the semester the students follow all media releases and related links on this topic using a rubric that outlines the key questions they should be asking as the affair unfolds. From time to time, the instructor integrates discussions of the evolving event into regular lectures. Raman et al. (2017) also choose a major ethical issue currently being faced by a company. Students are provided with press clippings and other information and have to write up a case and decide what the company should do in response to the issue."

To address this issue the literature provides several examples of student written cases based on their personal experiences. One of the purported advantages of this approach is that it provides students with an opportunity to reflect on past decisions that they or colleagues had made and to develop their own framework for similar future decisions. Laditka and Houck (2006) ask each of their students to write a case based on an ethics related experience that they or their colleagues have faced in their place of employment. The cases are discussed within small groups and selected cases are also discussed in a plenary session of all course members. It is reported that this process, \"is an effective teaching tool to encourage students to explore their attitudes toward ethical situations and value systems, and to prepare students for ethical challenges they are likely to face in the workplace\" (p. 164). Foster and Carboni (2009) observe that the traditional case method is limited in its ability to teach behavioral skills. In response they have their students write individual cases in which they describe a recent conversation at work during which they failed to achieve a desired outcome. The student must describe the situation, recreate the conversation, describe their thoughts and feelings associated with the dialogue, and identify discrepancies between thoughts and actions and between actions and desired outcomes. They must then construct an improved conversation and, if appropriate, try it out in the workplace. The result of this activity is expected to be an improved understanding of the self and an ability to be a more effective manager as a result of the development of more sophisticated mental models. Ashamalla and Crocitto (2001) note that students may find written cases to be uninteresting and therefore insufficiently motivating. On the other hand cases based on personal experiences have the potential to lead to greater learning. In response they require individual students to write a case based on an event or series of events they have personally experienced. Throughout the term the assignment is worked on, incorporating concepts that are being taught in the classroom. Students are encouraged to reflect extensively on the emotions related to the incident and thereby enhance their metacognitive abilities. In a crisis management course Powley and Taylor (2014) wished to develop their students' ability to succeed in uncertain environments. They asked their students to write up a case involving a crisis based on a personal experience or the experience of somebody with whom they were familiar. These cases are then discussed in class with a view to learning how to utilize critical thinking processes to conduct crisis management. Finally, Desjardins and Diedrich (2003) employ what they call a life cycle case. In a sustainability course the students are required to write a case study that traces the complete life cycle of a product with which they are familiar. They then analyze the economic, ethical, and ecological considerations that accompanied the evolution of the product. By choosing to analyze a product with which they are familiar students are highly motivated to participate in this assignment."

                                    "content": "Cases developed totally from publicly available information are often called archival cases. Rudin (2001) provides an example in the form of a discussion of the bankruptcy of Barings Bank. Students read the archived case and are then assigned a series of penetrating questions that can be discussed in the classroom. Henson et al. (2003) describe how an instructor in a strategic marketing course has his students choose a public company and, based on information available on the WEB, write up a case identifying a problem, some of the alternative solutions and their conclusions about what strategy to undertake. They call these WEB-based cases. Relative to the classic case method this approach allows students to learn how to search for information about companies and to address a very current issue. McDonald (2013) asks pairs of students in a course on crisis management to gather a number of media reports about the evolution of a crisis at a company and write up a case that discusses the major elements of the crisis and how the company responded. In addition the student pairs are subjected to a videotaped interview by one of the members of the faculty who plays the role of a journalist grilling the management of the company about the crisis and how they are handling it. Riordan et al. (2003), in an effort to stimulate student creativity, supervise the writing of what they call student constructed cases. Using publicly available information, individual students are required to write a case on a fictitious company in an assigned industry that is exposed to foreign exchange risks. Students are expected to generate an analysis of the nature of the exposure and its implications for the firm's financial statements. The resulting case and analysis are presented to the student's classmates. They concluded that this process promotes creativity, facilitates learning, and reinforces traditional research, writing and presentation skills. Corrigan and Craciun (2012) note that having students write cases from publicly available information often leads to cases that are not completed at a sufficiently sophisticated level (not edited, no teaching note) to be used in a traditional case class. In an effort to address this issue the instructors modified the student tasks to include; writing a case and accompanying teaching note, teaching the case in the classroom, and providing feedback to other teams on their cases. Interim drafts of the cases and teaching notes are read by the instructor and constructive feedback is provided. Another approach is to have students interact with and write an archival case on a real company based on interviews with their managers. Lincoln (2006) utilizes what he calls the Student authored case Method in which has students write cases in much the same way that a professor does for use in the classroom. The cases include teaching notes. This exercise gives students an in-depth knowledge of the case method and the company on which the case is written as well as a variety of skills such as how to gather data to research a topic and to lay out the data in such a way that it facilitates decision making."

Because students must understand the industry, firm background, and motivations of the key decision makers for each case the time available for problem solving and implementation of proposed solutions as well as the development of cognitive abilities is limited. To address this problem Kachouie et al. (2024) have proposed the use of what they call threaded cases. In their foundational course on business analytics they only use three cases for the entire semester. Students discuss and analyze the same case for a number of classes in a row but the nature of the problem addressed and the type of analysis required is different for each class. In this way the cognitive load associated with contextual learning is minimized and student engagement and focus on key learning goals is enhanced."

For example, Hamilton and Klebba (2011) develop a detailed course design process that improves the effectiveness of using experiential learning techniques (including the case method) to foster critical thinking skills. This process involves three steps; identify course objectives in terms of subject matter and cognitive process skills, select the method of instruction employed (such as a version of the case method), and specify the instructional process that will be used including the instructor's role and assessment methods. In addition to this general approach, we now turn to a number of more focused course or program design initiatives."

Harvard had no undergraduate program in business. Other schools gradually introduced limited numbers of cases into their undergraduate programs primarily in areas such as marketing and strategy but tended to avoid extensive use of cases in their more quantitative courses. One of the biggest challenges of introducing the case method into undergraduate courses is the large number of enrolled students and their lack of business experience. The result is that it is especially difficult to maintain a high level of preparation and student engagement during case discussions. To address these issues Harding (2018) developed the "

In the first phase students individually prepare for a case discussion by reading the marketing case and submitting answers to two case preparation questions before class. This increases the likelihood that students will come to class prepared to engage in the case discussion. When students arrive in class they are directed to discuss their collective impression of the marketing case with their team members. Then there is a discussion in a plenary session of all students organized around three central questions posed by the instructor. As each question is introduced, teams are given approximately 10 minutes to formulate a response. This allows students to adjust their thinking based on new information and insights derived from the previous discussions. Once teams have had an opportunity to discuss each central question, a representative from each of three teams is randomly selected to present their conclusions, resulting in all nine teams presenting at some point during the class. Because of the random nature of team and team representative selection, all students are kept engaged for the duration of the class period.

Klebba and Hamilton (2007) propose what they call structured case analysis to incorporate theory and to develop critical thinking skills within the context of a marketing course. Initially, the instructor provides lectures on theory. This is followed by classes devoted to sets of problems and then classes using highly structured cases. The course culminates with a series of classes devoted to the analysis of one or more unstructured (Classic) cases. They argue that this process allows the instructor to focus on specific theory related to the topic area, problems that enhance critical thinking skills and the ability to master skills required for unstructured case analysis."

Over time, as case research became more rigorous, a clearer distinction evolved between case research and the development of teaching cases. However, many authors still combine the two activities. One such example is provided by Paulson et al. (2001) in a series of cases written by a research team on companies in Belize. Each of the cases is focused on the managerial implications for an individual company of the advent of the North American Free Trade Agreement. By carefully choosing the sample of companies the researchers were able to reach conclusions regarding the application of organizational theory in an international context. The research was then used as the basis for teaching cases focused on the appropriate strategy that a company should follow in response to the Trade Agreement. Vega (2010) has developed a project that simultaneously allows students to practice research skills that enhance their understanding of business and to enhance a variety of skills such as creativity, decision making and the utilization of theory to improve the practice of management. In the term-long project involving selected small businesses, student teams do research that enables them to understand how the businesses work and then to develop a teaching case focused on a specific problem. The results are then presented simultaneously to the class and the management of the business."

The cases in these courses tend to take the point of view of the key decision makers in the functional area.

In response to this need, programs tend to offer an integrative course labelled as strategy or business policy.

(2016) give students in finance, management, marketing and operations a common case in operations management as well as a smaller case dealing with related issues focusing on their functional area. An operations management group provides their written analysis of the problem and proposes solutions. Rejoinder groups from marketing, finance, and management prepare a written critique of the analysis from their functional perspectives. Live cases have been employed in an effort to integrate several courses within a business program. These exercises enhance students' ability to operate within teams and to learn how to facilitate the interaction between teams. Elam and Spotts (2004) integrate three different courses in marketing (marketing planning, campaign planning, and desktop publishing). Marketing planning teams are \"engaged\" to present an overall marketing strategy to a live client. The planning teams \"hire\" a student group from the campaign planning course to design a campaign. The campaign planning team, in turn, \"hires\" a group from the graphic design course to design such things as the web page and brochures. The teams then make a joint presentation to the client. The client provides the students with feedback and chooses which of the groups makes the best presentation. In a less elaborate approach Kennedy et al. (2001) combine courses in marketing and entrepreneurship in projects involving several teams of students selected from both courses. The students are required to develop marketing plans for real small businesses that they have self-selected. At the end of the semester each group has to make a presentation to their live companies and to prepare a poster on their company that can be displayed to other students in the course. This activity is aimed at integration of learning across the two subject areas as well as enhancing skills such as developing their own approaches to both defining and solving problems, enhancing creativity and critical thinking ability, and collecting and utilizing the appropriate information."

The solution used by some business schools is to provide internships at companies. However it is difficult to find relevant internships, especially when large numbers of students are involved and in the face of the Pandemic. Howell and Aryal (2024) provide an imaginative solution to this problem in their information systems program by creating quasi internships. Students in a capstone IS course each select the functional area in which they would like to have an internship and the instructors provide student teams with a relevant Harvard Business School case.

The more realistic the situation the greater is the learning that takes place. Case competitions provide a somewhat more realistic learning situation in that students must reach a decision in real time. As a result case competitions are widely touted as a learning technique (Carter, Burke, & Hughey, 2019). As described by Menna (2010) and Gamble and Jelley (2014), in a case competition students are organized in teams that must each analyze a case that they have never seen before. Sometimes the actual decision maker in the case is present to evaluate students' presentations. The teams make presentations to a panel of judges, often chosen from business, who evaluate their presentations and declare a winner. Competitions can take place within schools or between schools and can be one of the requirements for a course or undertaken on a voluntary basis by students. According to the authors this method is highly motivational for the students, provides networking opportunities, and substantial learning can take place as a result of the feedback from judges. Corner et al. (2006) provide an example of a highly structured competition that is fully integrated into a strategy course. All classes in the course are designed to prepare the students for the competition which takes place during the final two weeks of the course. To ensure the case is current it is written by one of the faculty and released just before the competition. Participation in the competition is a required component of the course. Student teams hand in their written analysis and make an oral presentation. These are assessed by the faculty and four finalists are chosen. The finalists make a presentation to the protagonist in the case accompanied by five judges. A winner is chosen and subsequent feedback is provided to the student participants by the protagonist and the judges. In addition feedback is provided to all students in the course by the faculty. Corner et al. assert that case competitions are a form of grounded learning that has several advantages because they \"... create a real world experience, optimizes learning transfer, integrates theory and practice and shifts learning responsibility more directly to students\" (2006:432)."

Within this on-line context there have been a number of innovations in how course offerings take place. Regarding the case method, many of the innovations focus on how dialogue among students and instructors is implemented. One approach is to have all students on-line at the same time so conversation takes place in a synchronous fashion, thus attempting to replicate the in-classroom experience. An alternative approach is to have communication take place between participants in an asynchronous fashion with participants and the instructor posting e-mail messages on a bulletin board or discussion board when convenient over the course of several days. As Watson and Sutton (2012) have demonstrated each of these methods have their own strengths and weaknesses regarding student engagement and perceived learning. Other innovations deal with the type and format of information made available to students. For example, on-line methods permit downloading of information relevant to the case in a variety of media formats such as word files, videos, and audio as well as making updates of information immediately available. An example is the use of an application called Twine which is described by Kervyn et al. (2020). Hatch & Mu (2024) summarize a number of studies that empirically assessed the efficacy of employing the case method on-line. They observe that such studies are generally supportive of the on-line approach and conclude that it compares favorably with the CCM; offering greater strengths in some areas and relative weaknesses in others. However, they point out that there are many challenges in implementing the on-line case method. The following discussion identifies a number of papers that propose innovations to address these challenges."

The students receive copies of the cases online. They are then placed in teams that are expected to do a case analysis that is then posted for other students to see. A plenary session discussion of the posted case analysis takes the form of e-mails between participants. The groups who did the case analysis modify their analysis in the light of student comments and submit a revised version of the case analysis for grading. Rollag (2010) discusses how his colleagues at Babson College utilize asynchronous electronic discussion boards to facilitate discussion among online students. In particular he provides useful advice on managing implementation challenges ranging from course design and setting of learning objectives to managing on-line discussions and measuring student participation. Gill and Mullarkey (2015) wanted to convert an in-classroom version of a MIS capstone case method course into an on-line version. But two of the problems they faced were how to replicate the active in-class dialogue among students and the instructor and how to grade student participation. To promote dialogue they set up asynchronous discussion forums that took place over the course of a week. To begin the"

All other students were expected to participate in these discussions. The end result was very active discussion by most students. This was in contrast to in-classroom sessions that tended to be dominated by few students. Because the thread was saved it provided the instructor with detailed participation records for each student that could be graded for quantity and quality. As a measure of their successful conversion from the classic to an online version of the case method the learning gains of the two methods were measured and found indistinguishable. Mihret et al. (2017) wanted to stimulate active student engagement in their own learning process in an auditing course conducted online. Their solution was to have the students create what they called ePortfolios. An ePortfolio is an accumulation of posts such as answers to questions, a submitted assignment, and reflections on what has been learned. The instructors found that the e-Portfolios were particularly useful for the evaluation of student learning. On-line methods were seen as particularly effective in incorporating the views of persons from a variety of international locations. Kilbane et al. (2004) arranged for a case writer to continuously be on site at a company and provide updates on the WEB on evolving company issues. Students in five university locations accessed this information and had contact with the company in the form of e-mails, video presentations and periodic face to face meetings. The students were tasked with continuously responding to the issues faced by the company. This approach was repeated with another company by Theroux (2009) and this time 11 business schools in the U.S and Canada participated. In both of these iterations it was found that this approach engages and satisfies students at a higher level than do average courses and presents a more realistic and integrated view of business decision making. Moreover, it provides an opportunity to integrate the views of students at a variety of schools."

While we have no data to suggest that the use of the case method itself is in decline, we speculate (based on a review of the editorial policies and the most recent accepted papers in some of the more respected journals) that journals appear to be less interested in descriptive papers on methods of teaching with the case method. We wondered if refereed papers were being supplanted by other sources of insights that do not appear in academic journals. While it was beyond the scope of our paper to review all such sources, we noted that the Harvard Business School (HBS) provides a number of papers that, while not blind reviewed and published in journals in the usual way, provide insights into innovative ways of teaching with the case method. For example, Weiss (2023a) comments on the ways in which he uses ChatGPT to assist in preparation of case discussions. AI may be used to generate relevant case questions, sharpen the questions to focus on a description, diagnosis and action framework, explain how each question might relate to selected academic concepts, provide examples that illustrate the concepts the instructor wants to teach, and simulate the potential discussion with students regarding the concepts. In addition to papers, HBS offers a number of Webinars on the use of ChatGPT and other AI tools to maximize the learning potential of case-based classes (see for example, Weiss, 2023b)."

Also, some papers discussed attempts to replicate traditional in-class experiences in an online environment (Greathead, 2023). These papers were not included because they were not attempting to address a specific limitation of the in-class case method experience, which was the focus of our review."

We mention a few examples here. One conceptual issue that bears greater attention is the use of reflection. Most case method approaches involve reflection but the authors devote little or no time to discussing the goals of reflection, why reflection leads to learning and methods of improving reflection. This is a major oversight since it has been well established that reflection is a critical part of experiential learning. Related to this is the need to improve critical reflection in which the very basis of our beliefs is questioned. A third conceptual oversight is the role of dialogue. Just as with reflection it has been established that dialogue is a critical element in learning but most papers devote little time to explaining what is meant by dialogue, how it leads to learning and how to enhance dialogue among students and"

Given improved technology, working jointly on cases with students in other countries should be further explored.

The presumption of a western style capitalist system and the importance of enhancing shareholder value should be reconsidered especially in light of increasing income inequalities, a greater importance attached to sustainability and global supply chains that extend to non-capitalist economies. For example students should be exposed to cases in which the decision maker is the head of a union that is negotiating a wage increase, shorter working hours or benefits such as increased pensions. Another example is taking on the role of a politician who is fighting to lower the costs of prescription drugs, making dental care publicly available, providing subsidies to persons to purchase electric vehicles or protecting the environment."
