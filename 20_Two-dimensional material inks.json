However, the lack of standardized production methods offering a good compromise between performance and affordability has so far been a limiting factor for the application of 2D inks. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive description of the steps involved in device fabrication for different applications, from material selection and ink formulation to printing strategies and device assembly. We conclude with a critical overview of the main scientific and technical limitations currently faced by 2D inks and the related printing technologies, and discuss their market penetration and implementation stage."

This Review surveys the current developments in 2D inks, intended broadly as solution-based media composed of nanomaterials dispersed in a fluid carrier (a solvent or a mixture) allowing processing from the liquid state<sup>11</sup>. After providing an overview of the diverse types of layered crystals and of their most important properties and applications, we discuss the isolation of the materials and their stabilization in a liquid carrier, as well as the adaptability of the resulting ink to various deposition methods. We emphasize in particular liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) techniques, owing to their accessibility, simplicity and scalability. We also cover the available methods for 2D ink deposition and patterning and their requirements, and conclude by discussing the emerging applications, technological limitations and commercial opportunities for 2D inks."

However, electronic applications are rarely developed with solution-processed materials, owing to their strict requirements in terms of quality, size and positioning of the 2D sheets. Inks based on group IV Xenes are most commonly used in energy storage applications, in which their size and elemental composition are advantageous compared with common materials (TABLE 1)."

This process can be triggered by the collapse of cavitation bubbles (sonication-assisted exfoliation), shear forces (shear exfoliation), ion intercalation (electrochemical exfoliation) or particle collisions (FIG. 2a). However, LPE produces not only delaminated crystals, but also fragments and multilayered micro- and nanoparticles of all sizes and thicknesses. Thus, ink production always encompasses a sedimentation process in which larger particles sink to the bottom of the vial, followed by a centrifugation treatment to remove non-exfoliated material and to collect the 2D-material-rich supernatant (FIG. 2b). Owing to its simplicity and versatility, LPE has been extensively used to produce dispersions of several 2D materials (FIG. 2c)."

Sonication-assisted exfoliation (SAE) starts with the dispersion of a bulk layered crystal in a solvent, followed by material exfoliation by ultrasonic energy and removal of the non-exfoliated material by centrifugation[55]. Exfoliation is induced by alternating expansive and compressive ultrasonic waves travelling through the solvent, which can lead to cavitation events involving gases or microscopic voids present in the liquid. As the bubbles expand, their inner pressure considerably decreases, such that after they reach their maximum size they undergo a violent collapse[56]. If the system presents asymmetries, such as solid boundaries or other bubbles in the vicinity of the collapsing bubble, the process results in the ejection of a high-speed microjet, which induces the delamination or fracture of the layered crystals (FIG. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1). The solution is then centrifuged and purified."

In this process, an applied bias voltage promotes the intercalation of foreign species into the interlayer spaces of the bulk layered crystals[62] (FIG. 2a). The resulting expansion weakens the structure, such that delamination occurs spontaneously or by mechanical shaking or ultrasonication[62]. Electrochemical exfoliation is usually conducted in aqueous solutions of inorganic salts or mineral acids (anodic exfoliation) or in organic solvents with lithium or alkylammonium salts (cathodic exfoliation)[17]. It is a relatively simple technique, leading to the production of grams of exfoliated material in a matter of minutes or a few hours[19,60]. For instance, the electrochemical exfoliation of graphene in aqueous solutions of inorganic salts has a yield above "

Spray coating, in which the solution is sprayed onto the substrate (FIG. 3c), is a well established industrial method that provides high-throughput and controllable ink deposition and uniform film coverage. Desired patterns can be obtained with shadow masks, and the agglomeration of 2D sheets can be alleviated by ultrasonication spraying[57,80]. Inks for spray coating should possess a relatively low concentration, relatively high viscous modulus, and an elastic modulus that ensures liquid-like behaviour and sufficient flowability while enabling the retention of the system integrity after deposition[81]. To improve the quality of deposited films, inks can also be modified by adding surfactants or using two solvents to create Marangoni flow, which enables a more homogeneous redistribution of the nanosheets on the substrate (Supplementary Fig. 4D)[82]. Spray coating is one of the most flexible and cost-effective deposition techniques for 2D inks, and it holds great promise for commercial applications."

However, in low-viscosity inks, during drying the inner solvent flows to the edges to replenish the evaporated solvent, resulting in the accumulation of deposited material on the periphery (the coffee-ring effect, Supplementary Fig. 4B). Methods such as selecting high-boiling-point solvents, using two solvents, adding surfactants or binders, and substrate surface treatment have been exploited to alleviate the coffee-ring effect and improve printability[4,8,58,90,96-98]. To achieve uniform patterns with smooth lines and even edges, the drop frequency, substrate temperature and printing speed should also be optimized[99]. Non-continuous patterns, such as quantum dots and microarray patterns, can also be realized using ink-jet printing[100]. Modified techniques that improve the printing quality are electrohydrodynamic-jet and aerosol-jet printing, which enable higher spatial resolution and homogeneity[91,101]."

Among the various deposition methods for the fabrication of battery electrodes, 3D printing has attracted the most attention, owing to its ability to build open and porous electrode structures from 2D inks. Porous electrodes are critical for fast ion transfer kinetics and for a sufficient number of electrochemical reactions[23], and they also favour 'gas breath' in metal-gas batteries[124,125].

Sensitivity, selectivity, speed (response and recovery rate) and stability are four critical factors for sensing devices[129].

The thin-film transistors showed both high room-temperature mobilities and on/off ratios, and enabled the construction of functional logic gates and computational circuits[13]. Moreover, thin, lightweight, flexible and highly conductive films prepared from MXene and graphene inks exhibited excellent data storing and remote reading ability in radio-frequency identification applications[150,158], as well as excellent electromagnetic interference shielding performance[96], comparable to or even surpassing that of most commercial metallic materials, such as Cu, Al and Ag (REFS[150,159])."

Most solution synthesis methods introduce defects and impurities, lowering the conductivity and weakening the signal intensity. The second challenge is improving the linear dynamic range. Compared with conventional linear-response photodetectors (such as those based on Si, Ge and GaAs), most 2D materials suffer from relatively low linear dynamic range, which hampers high-resolution photosensing and video imaging applications[172]. The third challenge is simultaneously improving the stability and photovoltaic efficiency of solar cells based on 2D inks."

Nevertheless, the field is still in its infancy, and many issues remain to be addressed. The first and most important task is to systematically study the biocompatibility and long-term toxicity of 2D materials, which directly determines the applicability of 2D materials in bioengineering. The second task is to widen the applications of 2D inks in bioengineering, as most reported works are limited to bone-related studies. The third task is to develop new deposition methods to meet the complex requirements of biological environments; 4D printing — the fabrication of structures that can adapt and change shape or properties after printing — may be a fruitful direction to investigate."

In most fields (energy storage, sensing, electronics, optoelectronics and photovoltaics), devices are expected to last for decades, but in others, such as bioengineering, they should biodegrade within a short time. Approaches such as surface functionalization, heterojunction construction and defect engineering have proven useful to tailor the lifetime of 2D materials[186,187]. Another crucial issue is the biocompatibility and long-term toxicity of 2D materials in living bodies and ecosystems. In the context of sustainability and long-term environmental effects, 2D inks for end-user devices need to be recyclable, and a plan for the management of residues at their end-of-life needs to be in place. Graphene has been deeply studied in these regards, and its hazards are relatively well understood[188]. Fortunately, some of this knowledge can be translated to other 2D materials, as several of their interactions with the environment and living bodies are driven by their nanometric size and layered structure."

The first one, encountered by early adopters of 2D materials (specifically graphene), is the lack of standardization[192]. Graphene is produced by many manufacturers with very different prices and quality, but advertized under the same name. Poor-quality products generated distrust in 2D materials in general. The second challenge relates to price and mass-production capabilities. Only very niche markets are not price-sensitive, and price and material availability are the first and most common implementation barriers for new technologies. Finally, the third challenge is the compatibility with state-of-the-art processes. If a new material is not compatible with established fabrication processes, its implementation barrier is high, and needs to be compensated by a clear advantage and good price/performance ratio. For certain markets, the rule of 10 applies[192]: the new"

The value chain of 2D materials is at an early stage; pricewise, they cannot yet compete for well established markets and will not for the next 5 years at least. Also, although there are some reports of better performance in end applications than commercial materials, usually this good performance does not compensate for the large implementation barrier. Hence, for the time being, the market of 2D materials is limited to developing fields where existing technologies are not well established or are underperforming, niche applications in which price is not as important as performance (aerospace, science or health) or devices that offer additional functionalities at a reasonable price for consumers (printed electronics, biocompatible and multifunctional devices for example). 2D inks are mainly used for the latter type of applications, particularly in printed devices (FIG. 5)."

The compromise between performance and affordability is one of the strong points of 2D inks, making them ideal for these applications. Additionally, 2D inks are compatible with state-of-the-art printing techniques, which reduces the implementation barrier, and the added functionalities they offer (such as flexibility and form factor) are highly valued by this industry. Because the market for printed devices is just starting to develop, there is a great demand for new inks to improve overall performance, lifetime, encapsulation and efficiency. Although there are a few competing materials, there is no clear winner yet, creating a gap in the market that 2D inks are in a good position to fill. These inks have the advantage that their value chain has experienced fast progress in the past few years thanks to the multimillion investments made in graphene (through the Graphene Flagship, for instance)[193]: the market penetration of graphene is opening the doors to other 2D materials. This price advantage, combined with the rapid development of the 2D ink field, the constantly expanding library of 2D materials and their functionalities[27], and the recent emergence of a market for printed devices,"

In particular, for printed electronics with multilayer structures, high printing accuracy and spatial resolution are needed.

Their further development and implementation are still plagued by issues with production standardization and compatibility with currently available manufacturing approaches. These shortcomings may make it difficult for devices based on such inks to enter very competitive markets. However, it is clear that 2D inks are set to occupy technological and market niches in which low production costs are more relevant than high performance."
