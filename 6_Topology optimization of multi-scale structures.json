Recent years have seen a rapid development in topology optimization approaches for designing multi-scale structures, but the field actually dates back to the seminal paper by Bendsøe and Kikuchi from 1988 (Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering 71(2): pp. 197-224). In this review, we intend to categorize existing approaches, explain the principles of each category, analyze their strengths and applicabilities, and discuss open research questions. The review and associated analyses will hopefully form a basis for future research and development in this exciting field."

In other words, the structural design problem can be formulated as optimizing the distribution of material in a discretized design domain (Bendsøe 1989). The optimized layout is not restricted to its initial topology, opening for superior structural performance over manual designs based on engineers' intuition and experience. This capability is especially attractive and has been successfully applied in high-tech industries, such as aerospace (Zhu et al. 2016), automotive (Yang and Chahande 1995), architecture (Beghini et al. 2014), and healthcare (Wang et al. 2016)."

Theoretically, optimal structures comprise spatially varying geometric patterns spanning multiple length scales. Due to manufacturing difficulties of these multi-scale structures, focus in the late 1990s shifted from homogenization-based approaches to \"mono-scale\" approaches, optimizing the distribution of a homogeneous isotropic material (Bendsøe 1989; Zhou and Rozvany 1991; Mlejnek 1992; Bendsøe and Sigmund 1999). Popular methods such as those based on density (Sigmund 2001), level sets (Wang et al. 2003; Allaire et al. 2004), and evolutionary procedures (Xie and Steven 1993) all belong to this latter category."

In additive manufacturing, parts are produced layer upon layer by, e.g., extruding small flattened strings of molten material or melting and fusing powder material or wire. AM provides an effective means to fabricate complex mono-scale structures as well as delicate multiscale structures. In fact, topology optimization of (monoscale) structures and the use of lattice infill are recognized as two dominating strategies for designing next-generation lightweight structures (Brackett et al. 2011; Thompson et al. 2016; Plocher and Panesar 2019). The combination, i.e., topology optimization of multi-scale structures, thus holds the promise of superior performance in a general sense."

Many design approaches make use of multi-scale modelling, i.e., they assume separation of length scales. However, monoscale modelling can also be used to design multi-scale"

They made the important conclusion that in the limit of an infinitely fine mesh an infinite number of stiffener-like reinforcing members would occur (Cheng 1981). Only by restricting the variation in shape can existence of a solution be proven (Niordson 1983). For compliance minimization in 2 or 3 dimensions, Kohn and Strang (1986) proved that the optimal material distribution can only be found by relaxing the design space.

Using this theory, several research groups independently and more or less simultaneously realized that there exists a class of sequential laminates, the so-called rank- "

With this knowledge, Bendsøe and Kikuchi (1988) came up with the landmark paper that provided the computational framework to do homogenization-based topology optimization of continuum structures. Contrary to using rank-2 laminates that are optimal for a single load case in 2D, they came up with a single-scale interpretation, the square microstructure with a rectangular hole, shown in Fig. 3.

This method was introduced by Sigmund (1994) and is generally referred to as inverse homogenization. With compliance minimization in mind, it is common practice to formulate an optimization problem to maximize the microstructure stiffness with respect to the applied stresses or strains. For the difference in stiffness between such microstructures and the optimal energy bounds, see, e.g., Guedes et al. (2003) and Träff et al. (2019). Furthermore, microstructures with negative Poisson's ratio (Sigmund 1994; Andreassen et al. 2014; Clausen et al. 2015b), materials with maximum shear and bulk moduli (Sigmund 2000), or materials with increased buckling strength (Thomsen et al. 2018; Wang and Sigmund 2020) can be designed using inverse homogenization."

Sigmund and Torquato (1996) considered thermal expansion problems, while Torquato et al. (2002) included both thermal and electrical conductivity. Sigmund (1999) and Challis et al. (2012) considered combined stiffness and fluid permeability. Inverse homogenization for the design of phononic and photonic materials has been considered by Sigmund and Jensen (2003) and Jensen and Sigmund (2011), respectively. Lately, inverse homogenization has been applied to the design of photonic isolaters by Christiansen et al. (2019). For more details on material design using inverse homogenization, we refer interested readers to the review papers by Cadman et al. (2013) and Osmanov and Guest (2016) and the Ph.D. thesis by Andreassen (2015)."

When the design domain is discretized by a finite-sized mesh, such \"monoscale\" approaches typically result in mono-scale structures. However, as the discretization of the design domain goes high, it can directly be used to achieve multi-scale structures, since theoretical stiffness optimal structures span multiple scales. By employing careful continuation techniques and sufficiently fine meshes, and in the absence of regularization for mesh independence such as control of minimum length, perimeter, or slope, multi-scale structures should appear naturally. However, the appearance of fine scale structures may also be stimulated by controlling the layout locally. In these approaches, analysis and optimization of structures are performed in the full resolution of the domain, and we thus refer to them as full-scale approaches."

In the former, the design domain is partitioned into a number of subdomains that are further refined. The layout in each subdomain is enforced to be the same as that in the others, leading to periodic patterns in the full domain. In a variation, the subdomains are grouped, and an identical layout is enforced in subdomains per group, resulting in, for instance, periodic patterns along one axis with gradation along another. The enforcement of an identical layout in subdomains can be achieved by creating a template that links all subdomains. The sensitivity of each point in the template is the sum of sensitivities of corresponding points in all linked subdomains. This strategy reduces the solution space from the full design domain to one subdomain, or a few for a gradation or partitioning, but the analysis is still performed on the full mesh."

Zhang and Sun (2006) presented a first and comprehensive study on creating periodic patterns using topology optimization. It was shown that topology design results were greatly influenced by both the number and aspect ratio of the subdomains. Similar results were later reproduced using evolutionary procedures (Huang and Xie 2008) and level sets (Liu et al. 2018b). Almeida et al. (2010) presented a density-based approach to create pattern repetition as well as structural symmetry. It is worth noting that the subdomains do not have to be of the same size. Repetitive pattern with a variation in size was demonstrated by Stromberg et al. (2011) and Wu et al. (2016a) for architectural design, by establishing a mapping between points in size-varying subdomains. Lately, the principle of pattern repetition has been used to design mechanisms (Wu et al. 2020).

The idea is to impose an upper bound on the fraction of solid elements in the neighborhood of every point in the full design domain. This involves two important parameters: the radius of the neighborhood which affects the pore size, and the prescribed upper bound on the local volume fraction which controls the porosity. Since this creates a large number of constraints (equal to the number of elements), aggregation schemes such as the "

It is found that local volume constraints yield bone-like porous structures that are aligned with principal stress directions (see Fig. 2a). These structures are robust with respect to load variations, local material failure, and buckling, at the price of some decrease in stiffness. A typical way to ensure robustness is to model uncertainties such as material failure and load variations in topology optimization, resulting in distributed structures (e.g., Jansen et al. (2014)). This demands multiple finite element analyses per optimization iteration. In this regard, applying local volume constraints is an efficient alternative for robust design. The concept of local volume constraints is similar to maximum length scale control, which was introduced by Guest (2009) and later studied in Lazarov and Wang (2017) and Carstensen and Guest (2018)."

Subsequently, Allaire and Kohn (1993) proved that the optimal design for plane problem subject to a single load case can be described purely by the stress distribution in the macroscopic domain. Multiple load case problems, where the design is parameterized using optimal rank-3 laminates, have been considered for both plane problems (Allaire et al. 1996; Cherkaev et al. 1998) and plate/shell problems (Díaz et al. 1995; Hammer et al. 1997; Krog and Olhoff 1999). By choosing different plate layouts, e.g., using a fixed core thickness, Soto and Díaz (1993) and Krog and Olhoff (1999)"

Common in many of these multi-scale approaches is the use of homogenization to evaluate the effective material properties of predefined unit cells. Since the cells are predefined, homogenization can be performed off-line prior to optimization. This allows to generate structures with fine geometric details at a runtime computational complexity comparable to mono-scale approaches (Section 2.2). This is attractive, as evidenced by the large number of publications and industrial examples falling into this category. Predefined unit cells reduce the solution space of the microstructures to a dimension of 1 (or a few, see Section 5.3). This distinguishes this approach from hierarchical or concurrent approaches (Sections 5.4 and 5.5), where microstructures are represented by multivariable density fields. This distinction is meaningful for implementation. Since the solution space is reduced, it is convenient to construct a differentiable function that maps the reduced parameters to homogenized properties, and use this function in macroscale optimization."

Note that the unit cells interpreted as a material can be isotropic or anisotropic. An example of the former is a 2D beam-like lattice structure constructed from a regular triangular tiling (Clausen et al. 2016). In contrast, the 2D"

This suggests the optimization using cell-specific interpolations gets stuck in local minima. The number of iterations for obtaining both (b) and (c) is 400.

X-Shaped cells have large shear moduli, making it economical to place gray elements in the middle of the beam which is predominately under shear stress. Rank-2 material achieves optimal stiffness (f) due to the alignment of material anisotropy with principal stress directions, whereas the fixed orientation of the square- and X-shaped lattice cells restricts the adaptation of material anisotropy."

Figure 9 (top) shows unit cells independently optimized for an increasing material fraction, using the code provided by Xia and Breitkopf (2015).

In the first two, unit cells are optimized individually, while solid non-design regions or pseudo loads are prescribed along the domain boundary to stimulate connectivity. In the last, unit cells are optimized altogether, while a nonlinear diffusion term defined on the domain covering all cells is integrated in the objective function to penalize disconnection and suppress checkerboard patterns. Radman (2013a, b) improved the computational efficiency of the unified formulation by successively optimizing new unit cells, while considering connection to already optimized cells. Du et al. (2018) proposed a physics-independent connectivity index, which measures the amount of overlap in adjacent cells across the shared interface. Garner et al. (2019) proposed to optimize the connectivity, quantified by the physical properties of interest (e.g., bulk modulus) of an extended domain that covers adjacent cells. Poor connectivity between adjacent cells leads to an inferior bulk modulus for the extended domain as a compound cell, and thus is effectively suppressed in optimization. Figure 9 (bottom) shows results from this compound formulation.

This small error is also attributed to the limited and slowly varying nature of the microstructure which satisfies basic assumptions of the homogenization-based multi-scale modelling. This method has been demonstrated for optimizing up to 100 varying unit cells in 2D. Optimizing a large number of unit cells in 3D can be computationally expensive. Cramer et al. (2016) proposed geometric interpolation to obtain transitioning microstructures between individually optimized unit cells. This geometric approach works for microstructures of similar topology."

In recent years, the interest in this approach has renewed, resulting in simplifications and improvements of the approach (Groen and Sigmund 2018; Allaire et al. 2018).

In a different approach, de-homogenization is cast as finding a quadrilateral (2D) or hexahedral (3D) mesh with each edge being aligned with the optimized stress directions (Wu et al. 2021), borrowing ideas from field-aligned meshing (Jakob et al. 2015; Gao et al. 2017). Instead of decomposing a tensor field into three vector fields, the difference between the orientation of a (locally parameterized) quad/hex element and a stress tensor is measured by comparing all possible perturbations of decomposed directions. The cumulative difference over all elements is minimized by an iterative local updating scheme. This approach is demonstrated in combination with a modified version of the rectangular hole model. As illustrated in Fig. 13a for 2D cases, the unit cell is allowed to rotate "

To access the full solution space, while avoiding intensive full-scale analysis, an idea is to use a hierarchical formulation. Hierarchical optimization of material and structure dates back to Rodrigues et al. (2002) which was later extended to 3D (Coelho et al. 2008), both using SIMP. Comparable results were reproduced with level sets (Sivapuram et al. 2016). Hierarchical optimization combined with inverse homogenization is also referred to as concurrent (or simultaneous) optimization of structure and material (or microstructure). Like in approaches in other categories, here, a two-scale discretization of the domain is employed. The formulation involves one problem at the global (or macro) scale and many problems at the local (or micro) scale. The global problem determines the macroscopic spatial distribution of homogenized material, and local problems determine microscopic spatial distribution of solid and void phases by optimizing for homogenized properties. The structural equilibrium in the macroscale is in general nonlinear due to the microstructure adaptation (Jog and Haber 1996). A nonlinear resolution framework based on "

On the other hand, the independent nature of the local problems creates a critical challenge regarding the compatibility of microstructures across the shared boundary. We emphasize that the problem of concern is related to structural properties beyond the disconnected geometry, and thus choose to use compatibility in lieu of connectivity. The compatibility problem arises since disconnections between adjacent microstructures are not captured in the global analysis using homogenized properties (separation of scales). A mechanical indication of compatibility is the discrepancy between the objective (e.g., compliance) evaluated by a full-scale analysis and by an analysis using the homogenized properties (Garner et al. 2019). Some approaches summarized in Section 5.2 for improving compatibility in functionally graded microstructures are also applicable to the hierarchical optimization. For instance, by using extended domains that overlap in local optimizations, the compatibility can be significantly improved, reducing the discrepancy in compliance values between full-scale and homogenization analyses from six orders of magnitude to two (Garner et al. 2019) (see Fig. 14). While this is good progress, a discrepancy of two orders of magnitude is still alarming. To examine the optimality, we can visually compare hierarchically optimized structures with those from full-scale approaches with local volume constraints (Section 3) and de-homogenization approaches (Section 5.3). For a single load, orthogonal microstructures that are individually aligned with principal stress directions are known to be close to optimal. Such orthogonal microstructures are distinct in full-scale approaches with local volume constraints as well as de-homogenization approaches, but are difficult to discover in large regions of hierarchically optimized structures. A reason behind the poor compatibility is that the fixed, axis-aligned rectangular domain used in inverse homogenization is incapable of accommodating rotation of these orthogonal microstructures."

Such a formulation was presented by Fujii et al. (2001) for designing repetitive microstructures in the entire design space. Liu et al. (2008) incorporated a macroscale variable to concurrently design the microstructure and its distribution. Here, the solution space is reduced to a single microstructure, a strategy similar to pattern repetition in full-scale approaches (Section 3). The global analysis is performed using homogenized properties rather than on the full scale, assisted with an interpolation scheme called Porous Anisotropic Material with Penalization (PAMP). It was first demonstrated for compliance minimization, and extended for maximizing fundamental frequency (Niu et al. 2009), for considering load uncertainties (Guo et al. 2015) and more. Similar formulations and extensions using evolutionary procedures can be found in Huang et al. (2013) and more."

When the structural analysis is performed on the full resolution, a poor connectivity is reflected by a suboptimal objective. Thus, full-scale approaches naturally ensure good connectivity between microstructures or subdomains, at the price of intensive full-scale analyses. Therefore, results from relevant full-scale approaches may serve as a reference for multi-scale approaches of graded microstructures. From the comparison in Fig. 4, it is clear that a logical (but often underreported) consequence of using periodic microstructures with a fixed orientation is a large reduction in stiffness."

They observed that the material design problem is non-unique and highly nonconvex, i.e., different starting guesses result in completely different unit-cell designs and performances. Furthermore, a starting guess of the unit-cell shape and topology based on an optimal rank-3 microstructure resulted in a significantly better performance compared to the use of a rectangular domain. The parallelogram shape of the unit cell, which was optimized as well, allowed for periodicity patterns that cannot be described by a rectangular domain as seen in Fig. 15. Especially for lower volume fractions, Träff et al. (2019) observed that a unit cell with a starting guess and shape based on an optimal rank-3 laminate significantly outperformed (e.g., up to "

This effect has been acknowledged by Barbarosie and Toader (2014) who combined the optimization of the microstructure topology and shape. This approach can achieve structural designs that are close to optimal; however, an extensive comparison unfortunately has not been performed. To address the large computational cost included in solving the problem, the approach has been parallelized. To the authors' knowledge (and surprise), this is the only work on multi-scale topology optimization that simultaneously addresses the macroscopic design and both unit-cell topology and shape to get as close to the optimal design that can be achieved on a single length scale. Nevertheless, this method does not address the connectivity of the spatially varying unit cells over the design domain. More research has to be done to efficiently blend unit cells of different shapes together without a loss in performance to further advance this method."

While multi-scale structures are most often optimized, not surprisingly, by multi-scale approaches, they can also be designed using full-scale approaches with some additional constraints (Section 3). One important motivation of multi-scale topology optimization is to accelerate the computation for optimizing structures at high resolution. Here, it shall be reminded that theoretical stiffness-optimal structures span multiple scales. A higher resolution discretization enables the appearance of fine geometric details, which may bring the performance of optimized structures closer to theoretical limit. This, however, implies significant computational cost. Thus, multi-scale approaches are introduced for means of acceleration. These include the original hierarchical approach by Rodrigues et al. (2002), de-homogenization approaches (Pantz and Trabelsi 2008; Groen and Sigmund 2018), and works along these directions."

This restriction may be beneficial under various considerations, from structural such as buckling strength (Clausen et al. 2016), robustness (Wu et al. 2018), and multi-functionality to operational such as inspection and repair, and from manufacturability over aesthetics to sustainability. In this regard, the microstructures play the role of accounting for these considerations. From a mathematical perspective, it would be interesting to explicitly model these requirements and integrate them in an optimization problem with a high-resolution discretization. This is challenging, since a mathematical model of some of the requirements is not available yet or comes with computational complications. Thus, restricting the solution space by a reduced parameterization can be understood as a strategy to balance the defined objective and various other considerations. A general recommendation is to always motivate use of stiffness suboptimal microstructures. Too many works seem to forget this aspect and show optimized designs that are clearly not optimal with respect to stiffness."

This assumption often becomes invalid when considering the finite resolution of manufacturing processes. A general rule of thumb is that cells should be repeated 5 to 10 times before effective properties can be trusted. This certainly means that commonly seen approaches where one macroscale finite element corresponds to one microstructure cell, where cells may vary between each element, should be used with extreme caution. Interestingly, however, multiscale optimization, where microstructure is appropriately adapted to local stress fields, unimpeded by cell geometry or orientation (c.f., de-homogenization approaches) provides extremely good performances even for quite large periodicities, i.e., with lack of scale separation (see Groen and Sigmund (2018) and Wu et al. (2021)). The reason is that the optimal microstructures ensure purely tension-compression-dominated deformations at both micro- and macroscale, which homogenization-wise need fewer cell repetitions for accuracy than required for bending or shear dominated deformations. Under all circumstances, it is strongly recommended to verify any assumptions of scale separation with subsequent full-scale analyses. Full-scale"

In this regard, gains in one aspect are often, understandably, accompanied by losses in other aspects. Both sides are valuable for inspiring future development. These are especially important for researchers who may be less familiar with the topic, e.g., students, application engineers, and colleagues from other disciplines. Therefore, we strongly recommend to include a quantitative comparison (or a discussion if a quantitative analysis is difficult to perform, e.g., regarding aesthetics) when a new approach is introduced. Comparisons can be made on different levels, with non-optimized designs, with optimized mono-scale structures, with designs from alternative multi-scale approaches, etc. In the case of a 2D compliance design subject to a single load case, we recommend to perform a quantitative comparison with what is theoretically possible using rank-2 microstructures. To do this, we provide a Matlab script in Appendix."

Yuge and Kikuchi (1995) developed elastoplastic finite element analysis based on homogenization to optimize frame structures subjected to plastic deformation. Neves et al. (2002) addressed the problem of determining highly localized buckling modes in perfectly periodic cellular microstructures of infinite extent. Thomsen et al. (2018) proposed a optimization model to predict local and global microstructural buckling, based on which periodic cellular materials are optimized for maximized strength under compressive load. A systematic investigation of the performances of simple and optimized periodic infill structures in terms of finite scale stiffness and buckling was presented by Wang and Sigmund (2020). Strength of common 3D microstructures is treated in Andersen et al. (2021). Furthermore, Bluhm et al. (2020) proposed a framework for benchmarking the ability of periodic microstructures to maintain stiffness under large deformations, accounting in a unified manner both for buckling and softening due to geometric and material nonlinearities."

Some of the works along this direction have been mentioned in previous sections when specific multi-scale approaches were introduced. For instance, Das and Sutradhar (2020) presented an extension of the full-scale approach with the local volume constraints (Wu et al. 2018) to optimize heat-dissipating structures considering structural and thermal performance. Fluid flow through the pores in lattice structures is another interesting topic, relevant for design of actuators (Andreasen and Sigmund 2011) and biomedical implants (Challis et al. 2012). Furthermore, as discussed in Section 2.3, inverse homogenization has been used to design metamaterials with extreme or counter-intuitive physical properties such as a negative Poisson's ratio and negative thermal expansion (Sigmund and Torquato 1996). Designing multi-scale structures composed of such metamaterials is fascinating. It can potentially open innovative application areas in shape-morphing products, soft robots, and 4D printing (i.e., with an extra dimension of transformation over time)."

Integrating them in macroscale structural optimization would effectively lead to three-scale structures. The microstructures in two-scale approaches are normally defined in a uniform discretization of the macro domain, and thus have the same spatial extent."

Approximating free-form macroscale shape by square or cubic microstructures leads to staircasing on the boundaries. This artifact may be less of a concern when the macroscale domain is orders of magnitude larger than the microstructure size. However, with the limited resolution of manufacturing processes, the effects of this artifact may be non-negligible, both visually and mechanically. Conforming quad/hex meshing can be an alternative for constructing a boundary-aligned grid (Wu et al. 2021). However, mapping square or cubic microstructures into irregular grids may introduce error in mechanical properties. Note that homogenization assumes a repeatable domain, and thus direct homogenization over irregular cells seems not possible."

While being able to produce highly complex shapes and even structural features spanning seven orders of magnitude (Zheng et al. 2016), existing AM processes are not free from manufacturability and post-processing requirements. Structural design thus needs to consider, e.g., a minimum feature size, self-supportingness (i.e., free of critical overhang), accessibility for removing unsolidified powder or resin, and auxiliary support structure (Liu et al. 2018a). In the context of multi-scale design, these requirements (or some of them) can be satisfied by carefully selecting unit cells, e.g., beam-like lattice cells (see prints in Fig. 2) or self-supporting rhombic cells (Wu et al. 2016b).

Existing approaches are classified into full-scale and multi-scale approaches, according to whether or not the separation of length scales is assumed in the modelling. Full-scale approaches control structural details by imposing, e.g., pattern repetition and local volume constraints, while performing structural analysis on the fine scale, which is computation-intensive. Multi-scale approaches reduce computation by using analytical or numerical homogenization, under the assumption of separation of length scales, which may give rise to compatibility issues. These approaches are categorized in this review based on the parameterization of the micro- and macroscales."
