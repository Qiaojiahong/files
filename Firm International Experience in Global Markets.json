This problem necessitates a targeted study to investigate IE, compile its common conceptualization methods, and integrate the existing literature with a new comprehensive approach. The author aims to achieve this by employing Dewey's philosophy to define IE, reviewing 306 high-quality articles to extract extant approaches to the concept, and integrating these results to provide a new conceptualization. This article supports situations as generators of experience and demonstrates that previous approaches primarily focus on only some aspects of IE, overlooking the phenomenon as a whole. The new IE conceptualization is a seven-dimensional construct that includes length, breadth, depth, intensity, diversity, complexity, and echo. Additionally, the author discusses that IE can be analyzed at six levels depending on its origin (entry mode specific, international marketing specific, or both) and geographical scope (regional vs. global). The results provide a robust foundation for scholars and managers aiming to investigate and explore the realm of experiential knowledge and learning."

Another common approach emphasizes diversity in the environment as a generator of experience (e.g., Hortinha, Lages, and Lages 2011). This approach is also inadequate because it separates the social entity from the environment and neglects its interaction with its surroundings, which equalizes the experiences of all attendees in a specific place, regardless of how they live in that environment. Another approach relies on the interaction between the social entity and its environment (e.g., Bortoluzzi et al. 2014), but this method ignores the benefits of previous approaches. To overcome these inadequacies, some scholars employ a multidimensional approach to IE conceptualization.

This undermines theory building, hinders theory enhancement, and decreases the generalizability and comparability of empirical knowledge (Aspelund, Madsen, and Moen 2007; Hansen, Shrader, and Monllor 2011). Marketing literature requires a unified and consistent conceptualization for each construct to prevent conflicting findings and provide integrated practical implications (Zou, Taylor, and Osland 1998). Numerous articles note this emergence and call for a more comprehensive IE conceptualization (e.g., Brouthers, O'Donnell, and Hadjimarcou 2005)."

However, the literature does specify a similar attempt. As the only review focused on firm-level IE over the past two decades, Clarke, Tamaschke, and Liesch (2013) suggest that different conceptualizations of IE might not necessarily be conceptually contradictory. Each approach may consider only one aspect (dimension) of a multifaceted construct, and combining the approaches can provide a more comprehensive conceptualization. Clarke, Tamaschke, and Liesch's proposed IE conceptualization rests on this logic; however, the result suffers from some inadequacies. They jeopardize the generalizability of the outcomes by restricting the research context to the IE-performance relationship, and the study lacks a clear definition of the central concept (experience) and an analysis of its dynamics. Moreover, Clarke, Tamaschke, and Liesch analyze IE only at its general level, neglecting other levels of analysis such as entry mode experience. Finally, some critical dimensions of experience are not clearly emphasized, such as the impact of failed attempts and repetition. Nevertheless, I leverage their contribution to integrate the IE dimensions."

Finally, building on Dewey's basic principles and the logic of integration proposed by Clarke, Tamaschke, and Liesch (2013), I integrate the extant approaches with the basic principles of experience to exploit the overlaps and present a comprehensive seven-dimensional conceptualization of IE.

This is a critical step in unifying the literature and enhancing the generalizability and comparability of future empirical findings.

This alludes to certain patterns of cognition, sensation, and perception that permanently alter our judgments about our surroundings and form our behaviors accordingly (Ginsborg 2006; Oakeshott [1933] 2002; Restine 1997; Roth and Jornet 2014). Experiences should be studied in the context of a series of events rather than in an abstract form. Past experiences shape our interpretations of current ones, whereas current experiences determine our decisions for future paths and the context of future experiences (Dewey [1938] 1997; Oakeshott [1933] 2002). The interplay between our minds (perceptions) and the environment forms the link in this process. Experiences provide meaning depending on our perceptions while also affecting them. In other words, every experience is a reflection of ourselves and our background in discovering or arbitrating incidents (Russon 2003). When a social entity experiences something, it experiences itself in terms of its potential, abilities, perceptions, backgrounds, and so on (Landgrebe 1973). Thus, the inner side, previous experiences, and the interaction between inside and outside are critical in conceptualizing experience."

In these domains, experiences are evaluated according to how they promote the business and affect its outcome. They are typically investigated in a cumulative manner concerning their contexts and consequences, and not in an abstract form concerning their philosophical essence. Accordingly, investigating the notion of experience in this context requires a philosophical groundwork that focuses on the tangible outcomes of experiences rather than their abstract notions. Instead of concentrating on the philosophical concept of an abstract experience, we need a framework that upholds the results of an experience as a critical aspect of its evaluation and emphasizes the role of context and the process of accumulation. This framework can be observed in one of the fundamental experience theories of the social sciences. The pragmatic theory of experience presented by the novel philosopher John Dewey is considered a critical groundwork for any discussion on experience (Roth and Jornet 2014). I am not the first to employ Dewey's theory in business and marketing literature, although it is almost the only philosophical experience theory employed in various fields within business and marketing literature, such as education and experiential learning (Kolb and Kolb 2005). All these unique specifications distinguish Dewey's theory from others and make it a suitable fit for this study."

He called this combination a \"situation.\" Every situation is unique because every experience causes changes in at least one of the three elements. Thus, the next experience is not the same as the previous one. Therefore, we can say that an experience is the result of a change in at least one of the three elements of a situation, and this change does not allow two experiences to be the same. Moreover, experience creates meaning when a situation is formed and cannot be interpreted using any of its elements (Dewey and Bentley [1949] 1960). In other words, any experience conceptualization should consider the concept a concrete whole entailing its three elements, because an independent analysis of each element will not provide a valid result (Oakeshott [1933] 2002). Thus, a proper understanding of situations, their dynamics, and their differences helps us understand the notion of experiences. Perusing Dewey's literature led me to derive four principles that justified the dynamics of situations and the emergence of experiences. The basics of these principles are scattered throughout his books. However, integrating these ideas helped me bridge the philosophic notion of experience with the aim of this study, which presents a comprehensive IE conceptualization. These principles are briefly discussed in the following subsections."

According to Dewey, experiencing begins the moment a social entity is present in an environment. The \"environment\" is defined as all external conditions that interact with our minds to create an experience (Dewey [1938] 1997). These external conditions might share certain common specifications; however, once gathered in a situation, they share at least two fundamental dimensions: space and time (Dewey [1938] 1997), or, as philosophers say, spatiotemporality. Spatiotemporality is a feature of our sensibility and a precondition for representing objects and forming an experience (Kant [1781] 1998). It is a unique specification of every situation, as no two experiences are exactly alike due to the dynamic nature of time and the changing nature of the social conditions within places. Thus, spatiotemporality is the fundamental environmental dimension that distinguishes situations and their resulting experiences from one another."

The type and intensity of activity determine the extent to which we are involved in the environment. Greater involvement implies greater friction between the mind and the environment. Thus, we encounter more situations, and a richer understanding of the surroundings is expected. The principle of involvement states that experience is determined by the type and level of involvement in the environment (Dewey [1938] 1997). As the type or level of involvement changes, new situations arise. Deeper or more diverse involvement in an environment implies that a person faces more challenges (situations) in matching their mind with the environment. Thus, richer experiences are gained by those who are more involved in a specific spatiotemporality."

The continuity principle indicates that every situation is modified by previous experiences while modifying subsequent experiences (Dewey [1938] 1997). This means that a person can deliberately manipulate the next situation on the basis of the results of previous experiences. For example, previous positive experiences of visiting a town may lead a person to relocate to that town, resulting in a different path of experience. This principle also implies that experiences are interrelated within a chain of situations. Repetition occurs when a series of experiences share at least one situational element. This process is so critical that Aristotle described it as a foundation of validated induction, promoted universal judgments, and a valuable state of mind called intuition (Hamlyn [1978] 2010). Dewey views these improvements as growth. Although this growth can be interpreted in multiple ways, it is sufficient to"

Dewey ([1938] 1997) describes habit as the gradual formation of attitudes, sensitivities, and cognitions, which leads to improved responses to the stimuli. These formations result from the two principles of continuity and involvement. In other words, habit is the consequence of repeating a series of interactions. It basically relies on similarity and its crucial function, familiarity. Habits are formed when we are familiar with the next situation because of its similarity to the current situation. Dissimilarity indicates the extent to which the situations are diverse (unfamiliar). We use our memory during familiar situations but learn during unfamiliar ones (Dewey [1938] 1997; Kolb and Kolb 2005). In other words, familiarity increases the efficiency of reactions in similar situations, and unfamiliarity increases the richness of experiences and provides valuable opportunities to learn new things. The degree of variance between two related experiential situations (i.e., dissimilarities) determines the extent to which we can learn. Thus, the more diverse the next experience is, the more we will experience. The more homogenous the next experience is, the more efficiently it will be handled. Similarity promotes predictability and acts as leverage to translate experience (of replicable actions) into formality- or efficiency-based knowledge (Burgel and Murray 2000; Katila and Ahuja 2002)."

For this reason, the literature entails various categorizations of international experience and its levels of analysis (e.g., Chetty, Eriksson, and Lindbergh 2006; Clarke, Tamaschke, and Liesch 2013; Li and Meyer 2009). However, categorizing international situations as the origin of international experiences can help us integrate these attempts and provide a comprehensive approach to IE levels of analysis. In this section, I briefly discuss how IE can be analyzed at six levels. These six levels are differentiated on the basis of the approach to the foreign market and the geographic scope of activities."

Global situations are not restricted to a specific territory. They provide experiences with generalizable and transferable experiential knowledge that is practical for multiple markets (Chetty, Eriksson, and Lindbergh 2006; Johanson and Martin 2015) and applicable for the firm to coordinate its branches and develop critical global strategies, such as parenting. Regional situations are limited by at least one geographical or institutional factor. Although it can include a group of countries, a single country, or some states in a country, these constitutional subterritories in the region should share at least one geographical and/or institutional specification that distinguishes them from global situations and provides specific experience for firms confronted with that specification. Accordingly, psychic distance and the liabilities of foreignness play a significant role because some situations might not be perceived as new for firms coming from similar territories (Carlsson, Nordegren, and Sjöholm 2005). Experiences resulting from these situations are embedded in region-specific factors, such as the institutional context, cultural factors, market structure, and critical stakeholders' networks (Carlsson, Nordegren, and Sjöholm 2005; Delios and Henisz 2000; Li and Meyer 2009)."

Thus, building on previous SLR methods (e.g., Christofi, Vrontis, and Cadogan 2019; Tranfield, Denyer, and Smart 2003), I developed an eight-stage plan to meet the required qualifications: (1) define the aim of the research question, (2) design the search string, (3) select data sources, (4) develop inclusion and exclusion criteria, (5) refine the literature, (6) extract data, (7) present reports, and (8) synthesize meaningful outcomes."

This question justifies the selection of SLR to obtain comprehensive data on how IE is employed in the literature. From the concepts employed in the \"Theoretical Background\" section, a preliminary investigation of IE-related literature reviews, empirical studies, and suggestions from other scholars, I selected a set of keywords. These keywords focus exclusively on the notion of experience, separating it from similar yet different concepts such as experiential learning and experiential knowledge. Additionally, I included similar terms and synonymous jargon commonly used in the literature due to dissimilarities in applied terminology to define IE. Eventually, I combined these terms to design a comprehensive search string, as presented in Web Appendix A. I conducted the search twice, and I conducted the final search on January 2, 2022, to update the outcome. The search string targeted titles, abstracts, and keywords of the studies (e.g., Christofi, Vrontis, and Cadogan 2019)."

First, GS has been revealed to act as a suitable complementary database for SLR because of its vast and diverse journal coverage (e.g., Dinh and Calabro 2019). Second, experience is one of the most commonly used control variables in literature. However, authors usually do not mention control variables in their keywords and abstracts, although they conceptualize control variables in detail in the variable sections (e.g., Brouthers, Nakos, and Dimitratos 2015; Dasi, Iborra, and Safon 2015). These studies could not be found using the usual search processes within Scopus and WOS. Accordingly, because GS can search the body of articles and find studies that use IE as a control variable, it is necessary to include it."

For the next step, I deeply perused the articles to extract four parts: the IE conceptualization, the employed measurement method, the theoretical explanation and core reasoning behind the IE conceptualization or operationalization, and any expressed limitations concerning the employed approaches to IE. All extracted sentences were coded inductively, and the resulting codes were grouped. Accordingly, eight categories (i.e., groups of codes) were created. Each category represents a distinct approach employed by at least one study to conceptualize IE. The eight categories are presented in Table 1. The following section explains the results. However, for brevity, a parsimonious approach is taken; reports concerning the list of IE definitions, the evolvement paths of the approaches, and influential articles on these paths are presented in Web Appendices B and C."

Experience is recognized as what makes (experiential) knowledge through the (experiential) learning process (Eriksson et al. 1997; Hutzschenreuter et al. 2016; Petersen, Pedersen, and Lyles 2008; Sandberg 2014). Experience has no linear relationship with knowledge (Barkema and Drogendijk 2007; Yelle 1979) or learning (Anand, Mulotte, and Ren 2016) because not all experiences are learned and codified into knowledge (Dewey [1938] 1997). Similarly, concepts such as \"vicarious experiences\" are not actually experiences in their philosophical essence. As proposed in the \"Theoretical Background\" section, experience stems from a situation. However, vicarious IE is achieved by observing other firms' behaviors in specific international situations. Because the observer is separate from the process of experiencing, vicarious experience is more of a learning process than an actual experience."

Terms such as “intensity” (e.g., Hohenthal 2006) and “diversity” (e.g., Hohenthal, Johanson, and Johanson 2014) imply the foreign sales ratio and number of markets, as operationalized in some definitions. However, the following definitions are closer to the notion of experience. Swoboda, Elsner, and Olejnik (2015) define IE as the degree of involvement in foreign market activities, and Pehrsson (2008) highlights the degree of familiarity. Such definitions contain a closer approach to the philosophical principles of experience, attempting to enlighten the true notion of experience.

As depicted in Column 2 of Table 1, seven of these approaches are distinct, whereas the eighth approach demonstrates a common method for combining the other seven approaches. Columns 3 and 4 illustrate how common these approaches are within the domains of international marketing and business, respectively. Column 5 lists common codes in the first seven categories. These phrases demonstrate how the approaches are commonly described in the literature. The exhibition of these phrases in Row 8 is unnecessary because it entails combinations of other rows. Thus, I provide some common examples of combinations. Column 6 provides examples of studies that employ these approaches, which are discussed briefly in this section."

The common operationalization method of this approach, which is the binary question of whether the firm has ever operated abroad, is inadequate to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the level of IE. It is a bipolar approach that divides firms into two groups: experienced and inexperienced.

Therefore, it is commonly operationalized by counting the years of a firm's presence in a specific environment. This approach considers IE to be a dynamic resource that can be accumulated if the social entity remains in an environment. The basic assumption underlying this approach is that a firm's environment constantly changes to generate new situations. Thus, it is logical to admit that persistence in changing environments and maintaining business in various situations can provide experience. Nevertheless, this approach is not adequate for evaluating IE. Equating presence with experience causes negligence of the firm's activity in the market. Active and temporarily inactive firms are often evaluated equally as long as they are present in the market. It is mainly because the type and amount of activity is inherently neglected in this approach. For example, temporary exporters and equity-based entrants are considered equally experienced in this approach."

In other words, the more a firm perceives differences between markets, the more it gains experience from operating in them. Similar or proximate markets have more specifications in common with the home market, and the firm is familiar with most upcoming situations. In contrast, highly different markets are unfamiliar and can provide new experiences. Reliable frameworks and indices are commonly used to evaluate these differences and operationalize this approach (e.g., García-García, García-Canal, and Guillén 2017). However, this approach is also inadequate. It neglects that experience resulting from a specific distant market is not gained equally, even for compatriot firms, because of differences in duration, type, and number of activities."

Accordingly, firms that sell more will have more experience, and these experiences may help them increase sales. However, this approach is too concentrated on interactions, neglecting specifications related to both the firm and its environment. For example, this approach ignores that an equal number of sales among firms may provide different levels of experience if the customers are culturally different or if different types of sales processes have been conducted."

In other words, none of the seven approaches are invalid for assessing IE; however, they evaluate only an aspect of experience. Accordingly, combining these approaches can overcome their inadequacies and build a more comprehensive approach to IE (Clarke, Tamaschke, and Liesch 2013). The eighth approach relies on this assumption. However, no consensus has been reached regarding the combination of these approaches. Table 1 presents some examples of various combinations that have been employed to conceptualize IE. As indicated in the table, the combinations involve no more than four dimensions. This shortage stems from a lack of a comprehensive review to demonstrate all employed dimensions and a lack of a robust framework to validate the adherence of these dimensions. These are the two critical issues that this article addresses. In the following section, I follow the eighth approach and build on the framework extracted from Dewey's theory to integrate the literature."

Furthermore, I highlight the logic emphasized by Clarke, Tamaschke, and Liesch (2013) and employed by numerous empirical studies (i.e., the eighth approach) to argue that combining different approaches to IE can provide a more comprehensive conceptualization. In what follows, I integrate the approaches, justify them on the basis of Dewey's principles of experience, and combine them to propose a more comprehensive IE conceptualization. The results entail seven dimensions: length, breadth, depth, intensity, diversity,"

Spatiotemporality indicates that gaining experience depends on the duration of one's presence in a given situation. The second approach basically indicates the same for firms' experiences in international markets. Time enables a firm to face more situations, digest the resulting experiences, evaluate them, turn them into knowledge, and rectify its future behavior (Bruneel, Clarysse, and Autio 2018; Hohenthal, Johanson, and Johanson 2014). This enables the firm to internalize lessons learned from experiences and improve its progress by manipulating future experiences (Camison and Villar-López 2010; Hohenthal, Johanson, and Johanson 2014; Petersen, Pedersen, and Lyles 2008). Although the time dimension has also been labeled \"internationalization duration\" or \"internationalization age,\" I call it \"IE length\" because it demonstrates the period in which a firm faces international situations."

The third approach indicates the same for firms' experiences in international markets. Firms with similar IE lengths differ in the number of markets they face. International firms operating in more markets are more experienced in handling different situations and proposing divergent practical solutions (Zahra, Ireland, and Hitt 2000; Zhang et al. 2010). Increasing the number of markets motivates comparisons between situations and reactions, ultimately generating generalizable experiential knowledge (Evangelista and Mac 2016; Hohenthal, Johanson, and Johanson 2014). Because a considerable share of the knowledge gained by IE is transferable and applicable at different times and locations (Camison and Villar-López 2010; Welch and Welch 1996), firms with more markets are more likely to choose the best responses to various environmental stimuli (Hohenthal, Johanson, and Johanson 2014). \"IE breadth\" implies the number of different markets the firm operates in, which might not necessarily be geographically different."

Habit and the fourth approach are both dependent on the degree of diversity among situations. This may stem from the degree of dissimilarity between the markets or the firm's activities. Although both are possible according to the notion of experience, the former is more common in the literature. More diverse markets lead firms to face new challenges in upcoming situations. Overcoming these challenges provides valuable experiences that are useful in similar environments. Such enhancements decrease psychic distance and increase the firm's tendency to prioritize operating in similar markets (Eriksson et al. 1997). Thus, more distant and diverse markets provide richer experiences (Westjohn and Magnusson 2017). This logic justifies concepts such as cultural"

Diversified activities (complexity) provide a richer understanding of ourselves, making us more experienced for upcoming events. Firms with diversified entries are more likely to enter and handle different environments (Casillas and Moreno-Menendez 2014; Hutzschenreuter et al. 2016).

Aligned with the principle of continuity, the seventh approach highlights the effects of repeating one behavior. Firms are inclined to repeat experienced behaviors that provide tangible feedback (Collins et al. 2009; Pehrsson 2020). This repetition increases a firm's familiarity with related situations, reduces uncertainty, enhances efficiency in practice, and increases the success rate (Casillas and Moreno-Menendez 2014; Nadolska and Barkema 2007). These benefits are gained regardless of the (perceived) results of the experience (Argote and Miron-Spektor 2011). In other words, success and failure are valuable experiences that benefit the firm. Firms learn from these experiences and use the lessons learned to rectify capabilities, decisions, and future behaviors (Guler and Guillén 2010; Robson et al. 2019)."

Although the presented IE conceptualization aims to unify the literature, contextualizing the concept during its operationalization should not be neglected. In this section, I discuss two main issues that should be considered during IE operationalization. First, the operationalization of the concept is determined by its analysis level within the international situation typology. Second, not all dimensions are equally important in every study. The value of each IE dimension depends on the study's context and the specifications of the investigated firms. I explain this purpose further."

Concepts such as the \"Asia FDI experience\" necessitate a different form of operationalization than concepts such as \"foreign market experience.\" The operationalization of the seven dimensions should be coordinated with the position of the concept within the international situation typology. Moreover, scholars may find various indicators to assess each dimension within every typology level. Thus, I present Table 3 to demonstrate the common indicators employed in the literature for the operationalization of each dimension. Although providing a detailed approach to the operationalization of IE requires a comprehensive meta-analysis or empirical research, this report can be a good start to enhance the process. To better help future empirical and quantitative research, the examples provided in Table 3 are from studies that combine multiple dimensions."

There are always some limitations concerning the availability of data for authors working with archival data sets. Thus, when such shortages are observable, I suggest focusing on the specific aspects of IE and naming the concept accordingly. For example, spatiotemporal IE demonstrates that the research only reflects data concerning time and the number of markets. Similarly, it is better to name the concept \"IE length\" instead of \"IE\" when the number of years are the only data available. \"IE echo and breadth\" fits better when the only data available are the"

For example, IE depth or breadth is more critical than IE length for entrepreneurial firms and young born globals. These firms are often younger than five years; thus, IE length might not differentiate these firms as effectively as other IE dimensions. Similarly, the value of each IE dimension depends strongly on the industry's specifications such as technology, levels of uncertainty, the complexity of products, and the rate of change. For example, firms in the furniture industry and firms in the information technology and robotics industries do not gain similar volumes of experience over time. In addition, IE breadth and echo may play a more critical role in manufacturing firms than service firms. Moreover, an increase in sales may provide more IE for apparel firms than software firms. Thus, it is crucial to employ approaches such as categorization, weighting, and so on during the operationalization of IE."

Analyzing IE on the basis of the situation is a novel approach in the literature. Second, it entails a philosophical groundwork to validate each dimension, as previous reviews lacked such a robust foundation. Third, I introduced new dimensions for IE, as previous conceptualizations of IE do not observe more than four dimensions. This contribution significantly enhances the theorization of experience and provides multiple future research avenues. Thus, this article takes multiple critical steps to reduce confusion in the literature, prohibit contradictions in empirical findings, and integrate the literature by providing a comprehensive, generalizable conceptualization."

First, by providing a comprehensive typology of international situations, a new approach to analyzing various levels of IE is presented. Accordingly, a new step is adopted to diversify the concepts that indicate various aspects of IE. Moreover, this article illustrates the state of IE in marketing literature, demonstrating the locus of attention, and determining which IE levels should be investigated further. Although international marketing literature is replete with empirical studies that employ IE in its general global form, I found that international marketing literature has neglected lower levels of analysis. Generally, the concept of international marketing experience (IME) appears to be emphasized less in the marketing literature. Searching for IME in Scopus and WOS provided relatively few results that were mostly irrelevant. Marketing scholars should investigate the experiences resulting from international marketing strategies and activities. However, these topics have been examined by only a few international business studies. International marketing-specific situations include various types of experiences resulting from customer attraction and retention, planning, pricing, advertising, delivery, services, and so on. These experiences could be investigated separately or integrated within the concept of IME. IME is about the friction between the firm and its customers. Future studies could focus on this concept or its individual elements to expand knowledge of the effects of experience resulting from international marketing activities. I should add that any conceptualization of IME or its constituent elements entails the seven dimensions presented in this article."

First, the philosophical framework deduced from Dewey's philosophy could act as a robust foundation to investigate similar concepts such as managerial experience, marketing teams' experiences, firms' industry or domestic experience, and so on. Second, the presented conceptualization of IE could help researchers investigate critical concepts, such as experiential knowledge and learning, because it could provide a comprehensive approach to the sources from which a firm can gain the required information and the processes through which the firm can better codify these sources into experiential knowledge. Third, although IE has multiple dimensions, it would be interesting to determine how different firms in divergent contexts benefit from each dimension. As emphasized in the previous section, the operationalization of IE should be contextualized with respect to firm type, industry specifications, and so on. Different firms and industries stress each dimension of IE differently. Thus, future empirical research can provide fruitful insights by investigating these weights and demonstrating the divergent roles of each dimension in different contexts. Finally, as knowledge expands and there is no limit to investigating any concept, future IE-focused reviews could build on the groundwork presented in this article and provide an updated approach to different forms of IE."
