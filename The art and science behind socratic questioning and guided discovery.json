Question: This article attempted to consolidate definitions of both Socratic questioning as well as guided discovery, and examined the available research on Socratic questioning. Findings: Scant research suggests that Socratic questioning significantly reduces depression from one session to the next, particularly with patients with a pessimistic outlook, but there is no research on patient improvements at the end of psychotherapy. Meaning: Socratic questioning enhances the process of guided discovery in psychotherapy sessions and is a central way that beneficial change occurs for clients. Next Steps: To formally investigate the impact of Socratic questioning on patient outcomes using agreed upon definitions and reliable assessment."

Socratic questions (Overholser, 1993a) are integrated with guided discovery (Overholser, 2013) whereby the therapist directs the conversation toward the uncovering of core beliefs that underlie most forms of psychotherapy (Overholser et al., 2010). Socratic questions aim to help clients to think about their situation from a new perspective. Guided discovery is a process whereby the therapist works with the client to appreciate one or more central beliefs related to psychological change and adaptive functioning. The specific strategies of Socratic questioning and guided discovery can be used within many approaches to psychotherapy."

Also, the approach seems useful when helping clients to understand and change their dysfunctional personality styles. Depressed clients are most likely to benefit from a Socratic style if they display a tendency for pessimistic beliefs and if they are not otherwise being treated with medications (Vittorio et al., 2021). The assessment of patterns and the uncovering of beliefs are useful with clients who are open to the process of self-discovery and able to take a curious stance regarding their own struggles. However, Socratic questions may be too subtle or indirect for clients who are struggling with a psychotic disorder, developmental delays, cognitive impairment or a lack of insight."

A different approach is more aligned with Ellis' Rational-Emotive Behavior Therapy (David et al., 2021; Ellis, 1994) and retains a more directive and confrontational stance (Frojan-Parga et al., 2018). The present review includes research from both camps. Both styles are useful, and the present review aims to integrate the two methods of Socratic questioning."

These criteria provide a useful starting point upon which we will expand."

Instead of trying to solve a specific problem for the client, the therapist helps clients learn to solve problems by cultivating general attitudes that underlie emotional stability and effective coping (Overholser, 2013). Thus, guided discovery involves a therapeutic process whereby the therapist guides the client toward emotional stability and productive actions without providing direct instructions or specific advice. In some situations, the therapist promotes general issues such as maturity, flexibility, and"

The therapist often holds certain adaptive attitudes that seem to underlie emotional and behavioral maturity (Overholser et al., 2010).

These and other broad attitudes may underlie the goals for the conversation. During therapy sessions, the therapist may strongly encourage clients to consider accepting one or more of these adaptive beliefs.

In a study of four depressed patients, Metacognitive Therapy was combined with a Socratic dialogue to challenge beliefs about the benefits of rumination (Callesen et al., 2014). Through modesty, both therapist and client can effectively explore the benefits and downfalls of certain ways of thinking. Socratic questions such as, \"How have you arrived at that belief? What led you to that conclusion?\" can help clients to refine their own perspective (Wells, 2007)."

Each of these assessment strategies focuses on ratings provided by trained judges after they watched or listened to recordings of therapy sessions. These assessment methods will be discussed individually, with further explanation of the associated research studies to follow in the research review. We know of no self-report questionnaires or therapist self-evaluation rating forms that assess the use of Socratic questions or guided discovery. There is a risk that different investigators will be studying different styles, based on their own preconceived views of Socratic questioning, without a strong foundation in the historical figure Socrates as reported in the Dialogues of Plato."

The rating instructions highlight the use of questions to help clients seek new perspectives on their problems, to explore different ideas, and to test assorted hypotheses. Each item is scored from 0 (poor: a debate style of interview) to 6 (excellent: skillful use of questions to draw out new ideas) and a rating is provided after listening to an entire therapy session."

Frojan-Parga and colleagues (2011, 2018) examined videotaped recordings of therapy sessions, coding therapist verbal statements into seven functions identified by the researchers based on basic behavioral operations. Therapist verbalizations were coded for statements or questions that appeared to focus on assorted therapist functions, including reinforcement (agreement with and acceptance of something the client has said), punishment (disagreement and disapproval of a client's statement), instruction (providing the client with guidance for conducting behavior outside the therapy room), providing information, and motivating the client by highlighting the advantages of new behavior or the disadvantages of current dysfunctional behavior. Client verbalizations were coded for their degree of alignment with the therapist's goals and agreement with the therapist's most recent statement. The assessment system focuses on observable changes in client verbalizations that occur within a given session."

The coding system relied on a functional analysis of therapy sessions and was aligned with an operant conditional view of therapeutic interactions. Additionally, the assessment method identified an unfolding of a stimulus-response exchange throughout a session. Braun et al. (2015) used their assessment method to measure association with symptom reduction using two standardized depression scales, the Beck Depression Inventory II (Beck et al., 1996) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for depression (Hamilton, 1967). Vittorio et al. (2021) used the Beck Depression Inventory II to assess decrease in depression symptomatology, while also using the Life Events Prediction Task (Strunk et al., 2006) to assess the role of cognitive bias as a moderator on the reduction of depression symptoms resulting from higher use of Socratic questioning."

Instead, the use of Socratic questioning often aims to develop a balanced view of life, and this outlook may require a philosophical shift of perspective. Discussions may center around broad goals for life improvement, such as increasing a client's social maturity; helping a client to rely on rational decision-making when confronted with common problems involving loss, conflict, or rejection; improving tolerance for oneself and other people; and developing a general attitude of creative flexibility when confronted with obstacles toward personal goals. Thus, the outcome of these discussions"

It became clear to therapist and client that she had become focused on possible changes in her partner, overlooking her own role in the ongoing struggles experienced by the couple.

Even in the few studies that have been conducted, the participants and methodology have varied greatly, making direct comparisons less meaningful. Additionally, as noted above in the Assessment section, there is little consensus on how to define Socratic questioning. Thus, the critical evaluation of Socratic questions remains limited to a narrative review of a few studies."

The second group of investigators (Braun et al., 2015; Vittorio et al., 2021) has assessed the impact of Socratic questioning (using the Socratic Questioning Scale) on client depression.

Clients were seeking treatment for assorted problems, including depression, eating disorders, and relationship concerns. The same coding procedures were used, and similar findings were obtained. The investigation showed that therapists used differential reinforcement of the client's statements to gradually move the client toward the target verbalization, defined as the statement the therapist wanted the client to state by the end of their discussion. The debate was focused on client verbalizations that caused discomfort for the client. At times, the therapist highlighted the benefits of a different attitude. At other times, the therapist proposed more adaptive views, and asked assorted questions to check on the client's understanding and degree of agreement with the new attitude. The authors concluded that Socratic questions rely on a shaping procedure and described their approach to questioning as more directive than the Socratic style proposed by Beck, Ellis, and Padesky and the definitions proposed within this article. The researchers (Frojan-Parga et al., 2011) describe their approach to the Socratic method as aligned with operant conditioning strategies aimed toward a predetermined goal response."

The therapist's verbal behavior was categorized as a cue, an approval, a disapproval, or other, in line with operant definitions. Client verbalizations were similarly categorized as pro-therapeutic verbalizations, verbalizations approaching the therapeutic objective, verbalizations intermediate with respect to the therapeutic objective, verbalizations opposing the therapeutic objective, and other.

Videotaped sessions were coded for the therapist's verbal behavior. Statements were marked as indicating reinforcement or punishment in response to the client's statements, or providing information, motivational advice, or general instructions. In line with their prior work, the results supported the view that the Socratic dialog relies on processes of chaining and shaping to encourage changes in the client's statements. In a subsequent study by the same group, two categorical systems for therapist and client were developed from the already described outcomes and used to assess the strategic functions within the Socratic method (Pardo-Cebrian et al., 2021). The study used a problem-solving framework where questions were used to challenge the evidence and logic supporting the client's beliefs, as well as using questions to debate the validity or utility of certain beliefs. Results suggested that a therapist may use questions and an active debating style of discussion to subtly direct the flow of the conversation. In general, these studies focused on measuring changes in the client's verbalizations that occurred within a specific therapy session. The goal was to map the topography of sessions that relied on Socratic questions."

Fifty-five depressed adult outpatients underwent a 16-week course of cognitive therapy and depression symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II: Beck et al., 1996) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for depression (Hamilton, 1967). Results revealed that among the 44 patients who completed treatment, the more frequent use of Socratic questions (as assessed using the Socratic Questioning Scale) was associated with greater therapeutic gains as seen in a greater reduction of depressive symptoms (as assessed using the BDI-II) at the subsequent therapy session. This research was extended by Vittorio and colleagues (2021) who examined pretreatment predictors of treatment response, using data from the same 55 depressed adults. Results showed that Socratic questions had the strongest beneficial impact on depressed clients who were not being"

In addition, 21 patients met criteria for a cluster C personality disorder. Therapy was provided in group format, distributed across 11 sessions, and aimed to address agoraphobia as well as personality dysfunction. The use of guided discovery was rated by therapists after each session using a 0-100 scale: \"How well do you think you helped the patient discover new ways of seeing his/her problems?\" Results suggested that guided discovery did not have a significant impact on changes in emotional distress from session 1 to session 3."

The research reviewed relied on small samples or case studies, and the investigators used different research methodologies. Application of Socratic questions and guided discovery in therapy has been primarily supported by clinical experience. Although this limits the widespread acceptance of these techniques, it makes sense, given Socrates' tendency to focus on logical consistency across a set of beliefs and opinions. Another limitation is the severe lack of evidence-based definitions, constructs, and assessment measures for Socratic questioning, guided discovery, and patient-related outcomes when using these skills. Different strategies have been used to define Socratic questioning, which creates confusion between different investigators. The importance of agreed upon definitions and guidelines for Socratic questioning and guided discovery will be key to producing the necessary research to determine their effectiveness."

The skills and attitudes that underlie the use of Socratic questions are probably enhanced when trainees are well-versed in the Platonic dialogues (Dinkins & Cangelosi, 2019; Wharne, 2022). Learning the Socratic approach probably relies on small incremental changes through a combination of patience, curiosity, and a sincere desire to understand each client (Waltman, 2020). Trainees can learn about Socratic questioning and guided discovery from published books and articles. Role-played interactions can be used to demonstrate a series of questions that avoid the feel of an interrogation. For training purposes, we recommend the comprehensive books by Overholser (2018) and Waltman and colleagues (2020)."

Supervision can include concrete experiences, reflective observations, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation (Codd & Waltman, 2021). The improper use of Socratic questions can be highlighted by a supervisor by pointing out examples of excessive reliance on therapist knowledge or instances that lack a genuine curiosity in searching out new ideas. Creativity, patience, pragmatism, and empathy are central to understanding and applying guided discovery and Socratic questioning."
