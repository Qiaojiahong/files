However, networks are intrinsically limited to describing pairwise interactions, whereas real-world systems are often characterized by higher-order interactions involving groups of three or more units. Higher-order structures, such as hypergraphs and simplicial complexes, are therefore a better tool to map the real organization of many social, biological and man-made systems. Here, we highlight recent evidence of collective behaviours induced by higher-order interactions, and we outline three key challenges for the physics of higher-order systems."

It sheds light on myriad systems—everything from how rumours spread in a social network to how large ecosystems stabilize in spite of competing interactions between species. A key feature shared by such systems is that they are characterized by a complex set of interactions that govern their emergent dynamics<sup>2-4</sup>. In recent years, the architecture of social networks, ecosystems and the human brain have all been modelled as graphs, with collections of nodes describing the units of the systems—humans, animals or neurons—and edges encoding their pairwise interactions. This approach has led to the discovery that a heavy-tailed distribution in the number of contacts within a population causes the epidemic threshold to vanish, putting everyone at risk during a pandemic<sup>5,6</sup>. It has inspired the realizations that small-world networks and clustering promote synchronization<sup>7</sup> and that efficient communication structures tend to reach rapid and diffused consensus, but are also prone to the spreading of misinformation<sup>8</sup>."

However, it is not always possible to describe group interactions as sums of pairwise interactions only. b, Representations allowing for genuine group interactions include hypergraphs, which can encode interactions among an arbitrary number of units without further constraints. Here, shaded groups of nodes represent hyperedges. c, Simplicial complexes offer another approach. Although more constrained than hypergraphs, they provide access to powerful mathematical formalisms<sup>11</sup>. Edges (1-simplices) are shown here in black, full triangles (2-simplices) in yellow. Note that, in simplicial complexes, all subfaces of a simplex (for example, the edges of a triangle) need to be included. This constraint does not hold for hypergraphs."

Edges and hyperedges encode pairwise and group-level couplings among the nodes of a complex system. a, Hyperedges modulate group infection and many-body feedback in higher-order processes of contagion. Susceptible nodes (S, blue) can be infected by infectious ones (I, orange) in the usual way along edges, but also by groups containing a large fraction of infected nodes (for example, orange 2-simplices). b, Hyperedges have a similar effect on higher-order processes of synchronization, in which oscillators on nodes can be coupled along edges, or in groups via higher-order interactions (HOIs). c, Abrupt transitions emerge when increasing the strength of such interactions, suggesting a general pathway to explosive phenomena."

Finally, although many datasets can be easily visualized as networks, very few are readily described using a hypergraph representation. The challenge of going from the dynamics of units, and possibly information about their pairwise interactions, to a meaningful pattern of higher-order interactions between these units, remains substantial. In this Perspective, we outline the main signatures of new physics arising in higher-order systems, and we propose three key directions for future research."

Eventually, though, these additions produce abrupt jumps in the order parameter once the transition becomes inevitable. For example, synchronization can become explosive in heterogeneous networks by correlating the natural frequency of oscillators to their degree<sup>40</sup>. However, explosive phenomena are known to exist in nature, and developing a better understanding of how they behave is of key interest in many fields, primarily because they are more difficult to handle, predict and control than their continuous counterparts."

The most well-known set-up is probably the one introduced by Yoshiki Kuramoto[47], in which unidimensional phase oscillators are endowed with natural frequencies, and interactions occur through sinusoidal couplings. When generalized to account for structured higher-order interactions among oscillators, the additional nonlinearity generates abrupt switches between synchronized and incoherent states[48]. The emergence of bistability and the appearance of hysteresis cycles are driven by the presence of higher-order interactions alone, without the need for ad hoc coupling mechanisms between the dynamical evolution and the local connectivity of the nodes."

Tuning the relative importance of the strength of the higher-order and pairwise interactions provides a way, in both cases, to change the nature of the transition from continuous to discontinuous (Fig. 2c). The similarity of the mechanisms yielding a first-order transition in these two very different dynamical processes leads to conjecture that the introduction of nonlinear higher-order interactions and the tuning of their intensity form a general ingredient sufficient to provide abrupt transitions in a dynamical process."

This is a natural and intuitive approach, because it describes the evolution of the most basic units of the system, coupled through the only possible (and simplest) interactions in networks<sup>56</sup>. However, by encoding higher-order interactions, it becomes possible to define couplings between interactions of different orders (nodes, and hyperedges or simplices). More importantly, we can associate state variables, not only to nodes, but also to hyperedges and simplices. For example, the state of an edge can influence the states of its two associated nodes, while contributing to and being influenced by the states of the higher-order interactions (for example, a 3-hyperedge) to which it belongs. In this way, higher-order dynamical systems transform static interactions into active agents that are coupled to the rest of the system and evolving in time."

Consider a Kuramoto model defined on a simplicial complex comprising nodes, edges and 2-simplices (Fig. 3a). In this case, phases are defined not only on nodes—as in the traditional description—but also on higher-order faces. The equations used in the classical formalism can be directly adapted to higher-order interactions by substituting node incidence matrices with the appropriate higher-order analogues<sup>7</sup>. In simplicial complexes, these matrices correspond to boundary operators between interactions of orders differing by one—for example, node and edges, or edges and 2-simplices—effectively providing a canonical mapping between phase dynamics of different orders. Interesting phenomena emerge without adding further complications: the dynamics on 1-simplices (edges) displays a synchronization transition<sup>57</sup> that is only revealed when projected onto simplices of higher (2-simplices, Fig. 3b) or lower (nodes, Fig. 3c) dimension. Indeed, phase transitions appear in both projected dynamics, which are related to the irrotational and solenoidal components of higher-order dynamics. When these dynamics are coupled via the respective global order parameters, these transitions become explosive."

The description was improved even when simplicial complexes contained only nodes and edges. Higher-order Laplacians also provided the first formulation for signal processing on generic topological spaces[60]."

They are similarly incapable of discerning non-causal correlation. Circumventing this problem is only possible, in general, if we can make interventions, rather than relying on observational data alone[81]. Nevertheless, methods based on Bayesian inference of generative models are able to convey the uncertainty about the causal relationships[82]. An important future direction is to generalize such methods to incorporate higher-order interactions[83-89] that vary in time[42,43,90] and describe emergent higher-order geometry[91]."
