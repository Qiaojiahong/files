A total of 1,057 articles were selected, including 198 theses, 465 journal papers, and 394 conference papers. It provides quantitative statistics and analysis of the literature, using CiteSpace to conduct a bibliometric analysis of the data. Based on quantitative analysis and supported by the literature, this paper qualitatively concludes and summarizes the research hotspots and evolution of Chinese urban planning history from five dimensions: planning practice, system construction, thought and theory, figures, and discipline. The achievements delve into the exploration of motivations and mechanisms, planning ideology, methodology, practice subjects, and preparation process based on a staged review of the historical process of practice and a summary of its characteristics, which shows a process from partial to holistic and fragmented to systematic in general terms, contributing to the formation of a complete planning history research system. A comprehensive analysis of quantitative statistics, knowledge mapping of literature, and important research content reveals the characteristics of research into the history of Chinese urban planning over the past decade."

Planning history research in China stemmed from urban construction history as a branch of architectural history in the 1950s. Most early studies are scattered amongst architectural history publications. Planning history subsequently emerged as a separate field, with the gradual independence and expansion of urban planning and as a result of the accumulation of research into the history of urban construction undertaken since 1959. During the 1990s, research into Chinese urban planning was enriched by various historical studies of larger cities with a colonial past, such as Shanghai, Wuhan, and Tianjin. At the same time, scholars began to pay attention to and participate in international activities, such as joined the IPHS, contributed to international conferences. Rich experience has been gained in this process, such as research frontier and new methods, which further promoted the study of planning history. Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, research into the history of urban planning in China has been a common area of focus in planning academia. As the number of interested parties and scholars engaged in the study of planning history has continued to grow, a substantial body of academic publications has been accumulated"

After three preparatory meetings between 2009 and 2011, the Academic Committee of Planning History and Theory<sup>2</sup> was formally established in 2012.<sup>3</sup> The ACPHT is a professional academic organization affiliated with the Urban Planning Society of China, which unites the majority of researchers in the field, conducts research into the history, practice, and theory of urban planning and academic exchanges, and promotes the development of urban and rural planning in China. In 2011, urban and rural planning became an independent first-level discipline, rather than just a secondary discipline of architecture. Planning history as a secondary subject in urban and rural planning is an integral part of urban and rural planning. It also serves as a professional history and offers basic information for all research in the discipline of urban and rural planning. The promotion of the status of the discipline and the establishment of the academic community greatly contributed to the development of planning history research, which has produced fruitful results in the last decade. This paper takes the opportunity to review, reflect upon, and summarize past achievements in order to promote the continuous innovation of planning history and theory."

The terms 'planning history' and 'urban planning history' were used in searches, while 'title', 'keywords', and 'full text' were used as the search fields in each of the corresponding databases. The database selected for theses/dissertations was the China National Knowledge Infrastructure Theses and Dissertations Database, supplemented by the theses/dissertations database of the eight leading schools<sup>5</sup> in the field of architecture. Journal articles were searched in seven major academic journals<sup>6</sup> on urban planning. The conference papers were retrieved from the conference proceedings of the Annual National Planning Conference<sup>7</sup> (urban planning history and theory section) and the ACPHT Conference.<sup>8</sup> Multiple search criteria were used to ensure data integrity. A total of 1,057 articles were selected, including 198 theses/dissertations, 465 journal papers, and 394 conference papers. Theses/dissertations include the most advanced and cutting-edge research results. Journal papers reflect the latest research achievements in the academic field. Conference papers mirror the academic focus and latest trends. Thus, the selected articles balanced breadth, depth, and topicality, and they offered a comprehensive representation of the last decade of research into the history of urban planning in China."

In the quantitative analysis, basic statistics about the 1,057 records were obtained to gain a direct understanding of annual publishing trends and authors with high publishing volumes, before CiteSpace was used to conduct bibliometric analysis of the data. Keyword co-occurrences, bursts, and clustering graphs were generated using a software algorithm to intuitively understand the research hotspots. Based on the quantitative analysis and supported by the literature, this paper qualitatively concludes and summarizes the research contents and the evolution of Chinese urban planning history over the past decade."

The variation trend for the journal papers is the same as that of the total number. The annual number of conference papers presented a fluctuating upward trend between 2011 and 2019. In 2020, the Annual National Planning Conference was not held, while the ACPHT Conference was held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, the number of conference papers decreased to 26. The annual number of dissertations was always around 20 during the decade, except in 2013."

A notable example comprises Jinhong Niu's Analysis on the Culture of Modern Chinese City Planning Law.[30] Considering the evolution of urban planning legal thought and institutions in three important cities, including Beijing, Nanjing, and Shanghai, as a basic clue, the study explored key issues, such as important institutional organization, management style, planning legal thought, and important planning legal documents emerging at each stage of urban planning administration. It also summarized the historical process and basic development features and laws of localized urban planning legal thought in modern China, and summed up the historical process of localization development in China's early-modern urban planning law and basic characteristics and regulations."

Representative research results include A Study on the History of Urban Planning Education in Early-modern China by Wanli Zhang and a series of research into the development of the major urban planning of Tongji University.[48] The origins and progress of the planning discipline were elucidated by identifying historical sources and interpreting them. The discipline of urban planning in China emerged in the 1920s from three disciplines: civil engineering, architecture, and municipal administration.[49] In 1952, the first systematic urban planning major was established. In 2011, urban planning was no longer a second-level discipline under architecture, but had developed into a first-level discipline. Apart from clarifying the context of development, the study summarized the characteristics of discipline development."

In the meantime, the fruitful research results of the 'History of Early-modern Urban Planning in China' can be seen. In the last decade, research has focused on the history of modern planning, as well as more diverse objects and content. In terms of temporal scope, the focus on the history of planning in the Republic of China period is complemented by a significant increase in attention to the history of post-1949 and ancient planning. The geographical scope of the study extends from a focus on the built-up areas to the entire municipal area including natural elements; the perspective extends from urban to regional, and the distribution of cases extends from the eastern coast to the vast and central inland areas of China. Research case types have become increasingly broad. For example, ancient planning studies have focused not only on capital cities, but also on cities in general, and modern studies have not only focused on cities at ports of commerce, but also on cities at self-opening ports of commerce and non-ports of commerce. The research contents delve into the exploration of motivations and mechanisms, planning ideology, methodology, practice subjects, and preparation process based on a staged review of the historical process of practice and a summary of its characteristics. In the past ten years, planning history research in China has shown a process from partial to holistic and fragmented to systematic in general terms and has formed a complete planning history research system."
